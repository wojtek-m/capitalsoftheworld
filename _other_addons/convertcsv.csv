"""Afghanistan""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan,"""Afghanistan /æfˈɡænɨstæn/ (Persian/Pashto: افغانستان,  Afġānistān), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a  landlocked country located in Central Asia and South Asia. It has a  population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately  652,000 km2 (252,000 sq mi), making it the 42nd most populous and 41st  largest nation in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and  the east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in  the north, and China in the far northeast.Afghanistan has been an  ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration. Archaeologists  have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the Middle  Paleolithic. Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as  3,000 to 2,000 BC. Sitting at an important geostrategic location that  connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the Indian  subcontinent, the land has been home to various peoples through the ages  and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by Alexander the Great,  Arab Muslims, Genghis Khan, and in modern-era Western forces. The land  also served as a source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids,  Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Mughals, Durranis and others have risen to form  major empires.The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan  begins in 1709 with the rise of the Pashtuns - historically known as  ""Afghans"" - when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed  by the rise of the Durrani Empire in 1747. In the late 19th century,  Afghanistan became a buffer state in the ""Great Game"" between British  India and the Russian Empire. Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War, King  Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was  stopped by ultra-conservatives. During the Cold War, after the  withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United  States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan,  which led in 1979 to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen  forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million  Afghans lost their lives. This was followed by a 1990s civil war, the  rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government, and the 2001–present  war. In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council authorized  the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to  help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai  administration.Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world's  most dangerous countries. While the international community is  rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani  Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide  Taliban-led insurgency, which includes hundreds of assassinations and  suicide attacks. According to the United Nations, the insurgents were  responsible for 80% of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012. It suffers  from several challenges, including being world's most corrupt country  and is the World's largest source of refugees.""@en"

In the 19th century, they slowly and hesitantly began to establish  themselves in the interior. Angola as a Portuguese colony encompassing  the present territory was not established before the end of the 19th  century, and ""effective occupation"", as required by the Berlin  Conference (1884) was achieved only by the 1920s after the Mbunda  resistance and abduction of their King, Mwene Mbandu I Lyondthzi Kapova.  Independence was achieved in 1975, after a protracted liberation war.  After independence, Angola was the scene of an intense civil war from  1975 to 2002. Despite the civil war, areas such as Baixa de Cassanje  continue a lineage of kings which have included the former King Kambamba  Kulaxingo and current King Dianhenga Aspirante Mjinji Kulaxingo.The  country has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy has on  average grown at a double-digit pace since the 1990s, especially since  the end of the civil war.

It is bordered  by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north, Hungary and Slovakia to  the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and  Liechtenstein to the west. The territory of Austria covers 83,855 square  kilometres (32,377 sq mi) and has a temperate and alpine climate.  Austria's terrain is highly mountainous due to the presence of the Alps;  only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640 ft), and its highest  point is 3,798 metres (12,461 ft). The majority of the population speak  local Bavarian dialects of German as their native language, and German  in its standard form is the country's official language. Other local  official languages are Hungarian, Burgenland Croatian, and Slovene.The  origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg  dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy  Roman Empire. From the time of the Reformation, many Northern German  princes, resenting the authority of the Emperor, used Protestantism as a  flag of rebellion. The Thirty Years War, the influence of the Kingdom  of Sweden, and the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia, as well as the  Napoleonic invasions, all weakened the power of the Emperor in the North  of Germany, but in the South, and in non-German areas of the Empire,  the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control. During the 17th and 18th  centuries, Austria became one of the great powers of Europe and, in  response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French, the  Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804. Following Napoleon's  defeat, Prussia emerged as Austria's chief competitor for rule of a  larger Germany. Austria's defeat by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz,  during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 cleared the way for Prussia to  assert control over the rest of Germany. In 1867, the empire was  reformed into Austria-Hungary. After the defeat of France in the 1870  Franco-Prussian War, Austria was left out of the formation of a new  German Empire, although in the following decades its politics, and its  foreign policy, increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led  Empire. During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of  Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the German Empire guided Austria in  issuing the ultimatum to Serbia that led to the declaration of the  First World War.After the collapse of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian)  Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I, Austria adopted and used the  name the Republic of German-Austria (Deutschösterreich, later  Österreich) in an attempt for union with Germany, but was forbidden due  to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The First Austrian  Republic was established in 1919. In the 1938 Anschluss, Austria was  occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany. This lasted until the end of World  War II in 1945, after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and  Austria's former democratic constitution was restored. In 1955, the  Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state,  ending the occupation. In the same year, the Austrian Parliament created  the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian  Republic would become permanently neutral.Today, Austria is a  semi-presidential representative democracy comprising nine federal  states. The capital and largest city, with a population exceeding 1.7  million, is Vienna. Austria is one of the richest countries in the  world, with a nominal per capita GDP of $46,330 (2012 est.). The country  has developed a high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked 19th in  the world for its Human Development Index. Austria has been a member of  the United Nations since 1955, joined the European Union in 1995, and is  a founder of the OECD. Austria also signed the Schengen Agreement in  1995, and adopted the European currency, the euro, in 1999.""@en"

As such, the region, effectively independent since the end of  the war, is considered de jure a part of Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan is a  unitary constitutional republic. It is one of the six independent Turkic  states, being an active member of the Turkic Council and the TÜRKSOY  community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and  holds membership in 38 international organizations. It is one of the  founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. A member of  the United Nations since 1992, Azerbaijan was elected to membership in  the newly established Human Rights Council by the United Nations General  Assembly on May 9, 2006 (the term of office began on June 19, 2006).  The country is also a member of the OSCE, the Council of Europe, and the  NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program. Azerbaijan is member of the  Non-Aligned Movement, holds observer status in World Trade Organization  and is a correspondent at the International Telecommunication Union.The  Constitution of Azerbaijan does not declare an official religion, and  all major political forces in the country are secular nationalist, but  the majority of people and some opposition movements adhere to Shia  Islam. Azerbaijan has a high level of human development which ranks  lower than most Eastern European countries but ranks higher than the  Central Asian countries. It has a high economic development and  literacy, as well as a low rate of unemployment and intentional  homicide. However, corruption in Azerbaijan is widespread and the  country is widely regarded as among the most corrupt in the world. The  government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a 2009  referendum, has been accused of authoritarianism and human rights  abuses.""@en"

It is an archipelago with Bahrain Island, the largest land mass,  at 55 km (34 mi) long by 18 km (11 mi) wide. Saudi Arabia lies to the  west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway while Iran  lies 200 km (124 mi) to the north across the Persian Gulf. The peninsula  of Qatar is to the southeast across the Gulf of Bahrain. The population  in 2010 stood at 1,234,571, including 666,172 non-nationals.Bahrain is  believed to be the site of the ancient land of the Dilmun civilization  and later came under the rule of successive Parthian and Sassanid  Persian empires. The country was one of the earliest areas to convert to  Islam in 628 AD. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied  by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah  Abbas I of the Safavid empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah tribe captured  Bahrain from the Qajars and has since been ruled by the Al Khalifa royal  family, with Ahmed al Fateh the first hakim of Bahrain. In the late  1800s, following successive treaties with the British, Bahrain became a  protectorate of the United Kingdom. Following the withdrawal of the  British from the region in the late 1960s, Bahrain declared independence  in 1971. Formerly a state, Bahrain was declared a ""Kingdom"" in 2002.  Since early 2011, the country has experienced sustained protests and  unrest inspired by the regional Arab Spring, particularly by the  majority Shia population.

Its capital is Minsk; other major cities  include Brest, Hrodna (Grodno), Homiel (Gomel), Mahilyow (Mogilev) and  Vitsebsk (Vitebsk). Over 40% of its 207,600 square kilometres (80,200 sq  mi) is forested, and its strongest economic sectors are service  industries and manufacturing.Until the 20th century, the lands of  modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the  Principality of Polotsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the  Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. In the aftermath  of the Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the  Belarusian People's Republic, succeeded by the Socialist Soviet Republic  of Byelorussia, which became a founding constituent republic of the  Soviet Union and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist  Republic (BSSR). Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape  in 1939 when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were incorporated  into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland and were finalized after  World War II. The nation and its territory were devastated in World War  II, during which Belarus lost about a third of its population and more  than half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the  post-war years. In 1945, Belarus became a founding member of the United  Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.The  parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on 27  July 1990, and during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus  declared independence on 25 August 1991. Alexander Lukashenko has been  the country's president since 1994. Lukashenko continued a number of  Soviet-era policies, such as state ownership of large sections of the  economy. According to some organizations and countries opposed to  Alexander Lukashenko, elections have been unfair, and political  opponents have been violently suppressed. In 2000, Belarus and Russia  signed a treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a  Union State. Belarus' Democracy Index rating continuously ranks the  lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as ""Not Free"" by Freedom  House, ""Repressed"" in the Index of Economic Freedom, and is rated as by  far the worst country for press freedom in Europe in the 2013-14 Press  Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, where Belarus is  ranked 157th out of an overall total of 180 nations. For these reasons,  the country is referred to as the 'Last Dictatorship in Europe' by 'The  Guardian'.Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million resides in  urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic Belarusian, with  sizable minorities of Russians, Poles and Ukrainians.

Its capital and largest city is Sarajevo. Bordered by Croatia to  the north, west and south, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro to the  southeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost landlocked, except for 20  kilometres (12 miles) of coastline on the Adriatic Sea surrounding the  city of Neum. In the central and eastern interior of the country the  geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and  the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically  larger region and has a moderate continental climate, bookended by hot  summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a  Mediterranean climate and plain topography.Bosnia and Herzegovina is a  region that traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age,  during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic  civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has  one of the richest histories in the region, having been first settled by  the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to  the 9th centuries CE. They then established the first independent  banate in the region, known as the Banate of Bosnia, in the early 12th  century upon the arrival and convergence of peoples that would  eventually come to call themselves Dobri Bošnjani (""Good Bosnians"").  This evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century, after which  it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it would  remain from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The Ottomans  brought Islam to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social  outlook of the country. This was followed by annexation into the  Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which lasted up until World War I. In the  interwar period, Bosnia was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and  Slovenes and after World War II, the country was granted full republic  status in a newly formed Yugoslav Federation. Following the dissolution  of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the country proclaimed  independence in 1992, which was followed by the Bosnian War, lasting  until late 1995.Today, the country maintains high literacy, life  expectancy and education levels and is one of the most frequently  visited countries in the region, projected to have the third highest  tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020. Bosnia and  Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural  beauty and cultural heritage inherited from six historical  civilizations, its cuisine, winter sports, its eclectic and unique  music, architecture and its festivals, some of which are the largest and  most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is  home to three ethnic groups or, officially, constituent peoples, a term  unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosniaks are the largest group of the  three, with Serbs second and Croats third. Regardless of ethnicity, a  citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in English as a  Bosnian. The terms Herzegovinian and Bosnian are maintained as a  regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina  has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was  simply called ""Bosnia"" until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end  of the 19th century.Bosnia and Herzegovina has a bicameral legislature  and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic  group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the  country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities:  the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, with a  third region, the Brčko District, governed under local government. The  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of  10 federal units - cantons.

It is the world's  fifth largest country, both by geographical area and by population. It  is the largest lusophone country in the world, and the only one in the  Americas.Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a  coastline of 7,491 km (4,655 mi). It is bordered on the north by  Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and the French overseas region of French  Guiana; on the northwest by Colombia; on the west by Bolivia and Peru;  on the southwest by Argentina and Paraguay and on the south by Uruguay.  Numerous archipelagos form part of Brazilian territory, such as Fernando  de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and  Martim Vaz. It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador  and Chile and occupies 47 percent of the continent of South  America.Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the  landing of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500, who claimed the area  for Portugal. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808, when the  capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro  after French forces led by Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Portugal.  In 1815, it was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of  the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Its  independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of  Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a  parliamentary system. The country became a presidential republic in  1889, when a military coup d'état proclaimed the Republic, although the  bicameral legislature, now called Congress, dates back to the  ratification of the first constitution in 1824. An authoritarian  military junta had led the nation from 1964 until 1985. Brazil's current  Constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a federal republic. The  Federation is composed of the union of the Federal District, the 26  states, and the 5,564 municipalities.The Brazilian economy is the  world's seventh largest by nominal GDP and the seventh largest by  purchasing power parity, as of 2012. A member of the BRIC group, Brazil  has one of the world's fastest growing major economies, with its  economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and  influence. Brazil's national development bank (BNDES) plays an important  role for the country's economic growth. Brazil is a founding member of  the United Nations, the G20, CPLP, Latin Union, the Organization of  Ibero-American States, the Organization of American States, Mercosul and  the Union of South American Nations. Brazil is one of 17 megadiverse  countries, home to a variety of wildlife, natural environments, and  extensive natural resources in a variety of protected habitats. Brazil  is a regional power in Latin America and a middle power in international  affairs, with some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power.

It is the  only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder  of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and  Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012.At the peak of  Bruneian Empire, Sultan Bolkiah (reigned 1485–1528) is alleged to have  had control over the northern regions of Borneo, including modern-day  Sarawak and Sabah, as well as the Sulu archipelago off the northeast tip  of Borneo, Seludong (modern-day Manila), and the islands off the  northwest tip of Borneo. The maritime state was visited by Spain's  Magellan Expedition in 1521 and fought against Spain in 1578's Castille  War.During the 19th century the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The  Sultanate ceded Sarawak to James Brooke as a reward for his aid in  putting down a rebellion and named him as rajah, and it ceded Sabah to  the British North Borneo Chartered Company. In 1888 Brunei became a  British protectorate and was assigned a British Resident as colonial  manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during World War II, in  1959 a new constitution was written.

It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and Macedonia to  the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.  With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria  is Europe's 14th-largest country.Organised prehistoric cultures began  developing on Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period. Its ancient  history saw the presence of the Thracians and later the Greeks and  Romans. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the  establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 CE, which dominated  most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during  the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in  1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries.  The Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) led to the formation of the Third  Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its  neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world  wars. In 1946 it became a single-party socialist state as part of the  Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party  allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's  transition into a democracy and a market-based economy.Bulgaria's  population of 7.4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly  concentrated in the administrative centres of its 28 provinces. Most  commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and  largest city, Sofia. The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy  industry, power engineering, and agriculture, all of which rely on local  natural resources.The country's current political structure dates to  the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991. Bulgaria is a unitary  parliamentary republic with a high degree of political, administrative,  and economic centralisation. It is a member of the European Union,  NATO, and the Council of Europe; a founding state of the Organization  for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and has taken a seat at  the UN Security Council three times.""@en"

Cameroon's coastline lies on the  Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. The  country is often referred to as ""Africa in miniature"" for its geological  and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts,  mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is Mount  Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaoundé  and Garoua. Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups.  The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly  makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.  French and English are the official languages.Early inhabitants of the  territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka  hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers  reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos  Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani  soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century,  and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful  chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as  'Kamerun"".After World War I, the territory was divided between France  and Britain as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du  Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed  by France in the 1950s. It waged war on French and UPC militant forces  until 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became  independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo.  The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form  the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country was renamed the United  Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in  1984.Compared with other African countries, Cameroon enjoys relatively  high political and social stability. This has permitted the development  of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber  industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty  as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the  authoritarian president since 1982, Paul Biya, and his Cameroon People's  Democratic Movement party.

Pursuant  to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined  to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an  accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing  dominion. In 1931 Britain granted Canada full independence in most  matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The last ties were  dissolved in 1982 with the Canada Act 1982.Canada is a federal  parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen  Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the  Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the  federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and  multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many  countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December  2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying  chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade  networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States  has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.Canada is a  developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the  eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eleventh highest  ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in  international measurements of education, government transparency, civil  liberties, quality of life, and economic freedom. Canada's participation  in economic international and intergovernmental institutions or  groupings includes the G8 (Group of Eight); the Group of Ten (economic);  the Group of Twenty (G-20 major economies); the North American Free  Trade Agreement; and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.  Canada's alliances include the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO).""@en"
"""Cape Verde""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_Verde,"""Cape Verde /ˌkeɪp ˈvɜrd/ (Portuguese: Cabo Verde, pronounced:  [ˈkabu ˈveɾdɨ]), officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island  country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central  Atlantic Ocean.

"""the Central African Republic""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_African_Republic,"""The Central African Republic (CAR; Sango: Ködörösêse tî  Bêafrîka; French: République centrafricaine pronounced: [ʁepyblik  sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn], or Centrafrique [sɑ̃tʀafʁik]) is a landlocked country in  Central Africa. It is bordered by Chad in the north, Sudan in the  northeast, South Sudan in the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and the Republic of the Congo in the south and Cameroon in the west.  The CAR covers a land area of about 620,000 square kilometres (240,000  sq mi) and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008.  The capital is Bangui.France called the colony it carved out in this  region Oubangui-Chari, as most of the territory was located in the  Ubangi and Chari river basins. From 1910 until 1960, the colony was part  of French Equatorial Africa. It became a semi-autonomous territory of  the French Community in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August  1960, taking its present name. For over three decades after  independence, the CAR was ruled by presidents or an emperor, who either  were unelected or seized power. Local discontent with this system was  eventually reinforced by international pressure, following the end of  the Cold War.The first multi-party democratic elections in the CAR were  held in 1993, with the aid of resources provided by the country's donors  and help from the United Nations. The elections brought Ange-Félix  Patassé to power, but he lost popular support during his presidency and  was overthrown in 2003 by General François Bozizé, who went on to win a  democratic election in May 2005. Bozizé's inability to pay public sector  workers led to strikes in 2007, which led him to appoint a new  government on 22 January 2008, headed by Faustin-Archange Touadéra. In  February 2010, Bozizé signed a presidential decree which set 25 April  2010 as the date for the next presidential election. This was postponed,  but elections were held in January and March 2011, which were won by  Bozizé and his party. Despite maintaining a veneer of stability,  Bozizé's rule was plagued by heavy corruption, underdevelopment,  nepotism, and authoritarianism, which led to an open rebellion against  his government. The rebellion was led by an alliance of armed opposition  factions known as the Séléka Coalition during the Central African  Republic Bush War (2004–2007) and the 2012–2013 Central African Republic  conflict. This eventually led to his deposition on 24 March 2013. As a  result of the coup d'etat and resulting chaos, governance in the CAR has  dissolved and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye has said the country is  ""anarchy, a non-state."" Both the president and prime minister resigned  in January, 2014, to be replaced by an interim leader.Most of the CAR  consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas, but the country also includes a  Sahelo-Sudanian zone in the north and an equatorial forest zone in the  south. Two-thirds of the country lie in the basins of the Ubangi River,  which flows south into the Congo, while the remaining third lies in the  basin of the Chari, which flows north into Lake Chad.Despite its  significant mineral deposits and other resources, such as uranium  reserves in Bakouma, crude oil in Vakaga, gold, diamonds, lumber, and  hydropower, as well as significant quantities of arable land, the  Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world  and is among the ten poorest countries in Africa.

It is  bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African  Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest and Niger  to the west.Chad is divided into multiple regions: a desert zone in the  north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanese  savanna zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named,  is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. Chad's  highest peak is the Emi Koussi in the Sahara, and N'Djamena, (formerly  Fort-Lamy), the capital, is the largest city. Chad is home to over 200  different ethnic and linguistic groups. Arabic and French are the  official languages. Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced  religions.Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved  into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st  millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad's  Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade  routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by  1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960,  Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye.  Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the  eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1978, the rebels  conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However,  the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré  defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss  Déby. Since 2003, the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border  and destabilised the nation, with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese  refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad.Chad remains plagued  by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état (see Battle  of N'Djamena (2006) and Battle of N'Djamena (2008)). Chad is one of the  poorest and most corrupt countries in the world; most inhabitants live  in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers.

It  borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the  east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes  the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas,  and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about 1,250,000 square  kilometres (480,000 sq mi) of Antarctica, although all claims are  suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.Chile's northern desert contains  great mineral wealth, principally copper. The relatively small central  area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is  the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late  19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions.  Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a  string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of  fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.Spain conquered  and settled Chile in the mid-16th century effectively replacing Inca  rule in northern and central Chile but failed to conquer the independent  Mapuche that inhabited south-central Chile. After declaring its  independence from Spain in 1818, Chile emerged in the 1830s as a  relatively stable authoritarian republic. In the 19th century, Chile  experienced significant economic and territorial growth ending Mapuche  resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in  the War of the Pacific (1879–83) after defeating Peru and Bolivia. In  the late 1960s and early 1970s, the country experienced severe  left-right political polarization and turmoil. This development  culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that overthrew Salvador  Allende's left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing  military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing.  The dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet ended in 1990 after it lost a  referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a centre-left coalition which  ruled through four presidencies until 2010.Today, Chile is one of South  America's most stable and prosperous nations. It leads Latin American  nations in rankings of human development, competitiveness, income per  capita, globalization, state of peace, economic freedom, and low  perception of corruption. It also ranks high regionally in  sustainability of the state, and democratic development.

It is the world's most  populous country, with a population of over 1.35 billion. The PRC is a  single-party state governed by the Communist Party, with its seat of  government in the capital city of Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction  over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled  municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two  mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and  Macau). The PRC also claims Taiwan – which is controlled by the Republic  of China (ROC), a separate political entity – as its 23rd province, a  claim which is controversial due to the complex political status of  Taiwan.Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is  the world's second-largest country by land area, and either the third or  fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement.  China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and  the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests  in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan  mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze  and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from  the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's  coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long,  and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.The  history of China goes back to the ancient civilization – one of the  world's earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow  River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system  was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with  the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since  221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a  Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed  numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty  in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of  the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the  nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People's  Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang  relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei.Since the  introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the  world's fastest-growing major economies. As of 2013, it is the world's  second-largest economy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power  parity (PPP), and is also the world's largest exporter and importer of  goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's  largest standing army, with the second-largest defense budget. The PRC  has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as  a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member  of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including  the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the BCIM  and the G-20.

It is a unitary,  constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments.The territory  of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples  including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and Tairona. The Spanish arrived in 1499  and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately creating  the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with its capital at Bogotá.  Independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 ""Gran Colombia"" had  collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador. What is now  Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic of New Granada. The new  nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation  (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the  Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. Panama seceded in  1903.Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric  low-intensity armed conflict. The conflict escalated in the 1990s, but  since 2000 the conflict has decreased considerably.Colombia is  ethnically diverse, the descendants of the original native inhabitants,  Spanish colonists, Africans originally brought to the country as slaves,  and 20th-century immigrants from Europe and the Middle East have  produced a diverse cultural heritage.

The population, excluding  Mayotte, is estimated at 798,000. Although speculated today by Arab  countries that the name Comoros originated from Arab people who arrived  in the islands much later, the name ""Comoros"" actually came from ancient  Polynesian, Melanesian and Australian people who settled among the  original African population B.C. ""Comoros"" was taken from the ancient  Polynesian word ""Chammoras"", one of their other settlements.[citation  needed] These inhabitants had their own distinct language ""Comorian""  which was partly affected by the Arabs who arrived much later.

Mayotte, however, has  never been administered by the Comoros government (or, before  independence, its predecessors). Instead, Mayotte continues to be  administered by France (currently as an overseas department) as it was  the only island in the archipelago that voted against independence in  1974. France has since vetoed United Nations Security Council  resolutions that would affirm Comorian sovereignty over the island.

Its capital and largest city is Zagreb.  The country is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb. Croatia  covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles) and has diverse,  mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea  coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is  4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious  denomination being Roman Catholicism. The Croats arrived in the area of  present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They  organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became  the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom.  The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two  centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Krešimir IV  and Dmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in  1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament  elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In  1918, after World War I, Croatia was included in the unrecognised State  of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs which seceded from Austria–Hungary and  merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A fascist Croatian puppet state  existed during World War II. After the war, Croatia became a founding  member and a federal constituent of Second Yugoslavia, a socialist  state. In June 1991, Croatia declared independence, which came into  effect on 8 October of the same year. The Croatian War of Independence  was fought successfully during the four years following the  declaration.Croatia today has a very high Human Development Index. The  International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and  developing economy, and the World Bank identified it as a high income  economy. Croatia is a member of the European Union, United Nations, the  Council of Europe, NATO, the World Trade Organization and a founding  member of the Union for the Mediterranean. As an active participant in  the UN peacekeeping forces, Croatia has contributed troops to the  NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN  Security Council for the 2008–2009 term.The service sector dominates  Croatia's economy, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture.  Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with  Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world.  The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government  expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important trading  partner. Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in  infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the  Pan-European corridors. Internal sources produce a significant portion  of energy in Croatia; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a universal  health care system and free primary and secondary education, while  supporting culture through numerous public institutions and through  corporate investments in media and publishing.""@en"

The nation of Cuba comprises the main island  of Cuba, the Isla de la Juventud, and several archipelagos. Havana is  the capital of Cuba and its largest city. The second largest city is  Santiago de Cuba. To the north of Cuba lies the United States (150 km or  93 mi away) and the Bahamas are to the northeast, Mexico is to the west  (210 km or 130 mi away), the Cayman Islands and Jamaica are to the  south, and Haiti and the Dominican Republic are to the southeast.The  island of Cuba was inhabited by numerous Mesoamerican tribes prior to  the landing of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492, who  claimed it for the Kingdom of Spain. Cuba remained a colony of Spain  until the Spanish–American War of 1898, after which it was briefly  administered by the United States until gaining nominal independence in  1902. The fragile republic endured increasingly radical politics and  social strife, and despite efforts to strengthen its democratic system,  Cuba came under the dictatorship of former president Fulgencio Batista  in 1952. Growing unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in  January 1959 by the July 26 movement, which afterwards established a new  socialist administration under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since  1965, the country has been governed as a single-party state by the  Communist Party.Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, and with  over 11 million inhabitants, is the second-most populous after  Hispaniola, albeit with a much lower population density than most  nations in the region. A multiethnic country, its people, culture, and  customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal Taíno and  Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the  introduction of African slaves, a close relationship with the Soviet  Union during the Cold War, and proximity to the United States.Cuba ranks  high in metrics of health and education, with a high Human Development  Index of 0.780 as of 2013.

"""Cyprus""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus,"""Cyprus /ˈsaɪprəs/ (Greek: Κύπρος [ˈcipros]; Turkish: Kıbrıs  [ˈkɯbɾɯs]), officially the Republic of Cyprus (Greek: Κυπριακή  Δημοκρατία; Turkish: Kıbrıs Cumhuriyeti), is an island country in the  Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Cyprus is the third largest and third most  populous island in the Mediterranean, and a member state of the European  Union. It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon,  northwest of Israel, north of Egypt and east of Greece.The earliest  known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium  BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved  Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the  oldest water wells in the world. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks  in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. At a strategic location in the  Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers,  including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from  whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent  rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Roman Empire, the Byzantines, Arab  caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the  Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman control.  Cyprus was placed under British administration in 1878 until it was  granted independence in 1960, becoming a member of the Commonwealth the  following year. In 1974, seven years after the intercommunal violence  between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, an attempted coup d'état by  Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta  with the aim of achieving enosis (union of the island with Greece) took  place. Turkey used this as a pretext to invade the northern portion of  the island. Turkish forces remained after a cease-fire, resulting in the  partition of the island; an objective of Turkey since 1955. The  intercommunal violence and subsequent Turkish invasion led to the  displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots,  and the establishment of a separate Turkish Cypriot political entity in  the north. These events and the resulting political situation are  matters of a continuing dispute.The Republic of Cyprus has de jure  sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters,  according to international law, except for the British Overseas  Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base  Areas. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two  main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic,  comprising about 59% of the island's area, and the Turkish-controlled  area in the north, calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus and recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island's  area. The international community considers the northern part of the  island as territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish  forces.Cyprus is a major tourist destination in the Mediterranean. An  advanced, high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index,  the Republic of Cyprus was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  until it joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.

The country is bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the  south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the north. Prague is the  capital and largest city, with 1.3 million residents. The Czech Republic  includes the historical territories of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as a  small part of Silesia.The Czech state, formerly known as Bohemia  (Čechy), was formed in the late 9th century as a small duchy around  Prague, at that time under the dominance of the powerful Great Moravian  Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power was  transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslids. In 1002,  Bohemia was formally recognized as a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire,  rising to the status of kingdom in 1212. During the rule of the  Přemyslids and their successors, the Luxembourgs, Bohemia expanded in  size until reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century.  During the Hussite wars, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and  crusades from all over Europe. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526,  the Kingdom of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg  monarchy as one of its three principal parts, alongside the Archduchy of  Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Bohemian Revolt (1618–20)  against Habsburg rule led to the Thirty Years' War, after which the  monarchy consolidated its rule, re-imposed Catholicism, and enforced a  policy of Germanization. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire  in 1806, the Bohemian kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire. In the  19th century the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the  monarchy and the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was  formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire  after World War I. After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only  democracy in central and eastern Europe.Following the Munich Agreement  and the Polish annexation of Zaolzie, Czechoslovakia fell under German  occupation during World War II. By 1945, a major portion of the country  was liberated by the Red Army, and the subsequent gratitude towards the  Soviets, combined with disillusionment with the West for failing to  intervene, led the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to victory in the  1946 elections. Following the 1948 coup d'état, Czechoslovakia became a  single-party communist state under Soviet influence. In 1968, increasing  dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known  as the Prague Spring, which ended with an invasion by the armies of the  Warsaw Pact countries (with the exception of Romania). Czechoslovakia  remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist  regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed. On 1  January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent  states: the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.In 2006, the Czech  Republic became first former member of the Comecon to achieve the status  of a developed country, according to the World Bank. The country has  the highest level of human development in Central and Eastern Europe,  ranking among the top 30 nations in the world. The Czech Republic ranks  as the ninth-most peaceful country in Europe, while achieving the best  performance in democratic governance and infant mortality in the region.

It has the second-highest total Christian  population in Africa.The Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated  the country and is sometimes referred to as the ""African world war""  because it involved nine African nations and twenty armed groups.  Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continued in the  east of the country in 2007. There, the prevalence of rape and other  sexual violence has been described as the worst in the world. The war is  the world's deadliest conflict since the Chinese Civil War, killing 5.4  million people since 1998. More than 90% were not killed in combat,  dying instead from malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition,  aggravated by displaced populations living in unsanitary and  over-crowded conditions that lacked access to shelter, water, food and  medicine.

The Kingdom includes two autonomous constituent  countries in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.  At 43,094 square kilometres (16,638.69 sq mi), with a population of  around 5.6 million inhabitants, Denmark consists of a peninsula,  Jutland, and the Danish archipelago of 407 islands, of which around 70  are inhabited. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and  sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. The national  language, Danish, is closely related to and mutually intelligible with  Swedish and Norwegian.The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary constitutional  monarchy, with Margrethe II as queen regnant, organised as a  parliamentary democracy. The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5  June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. The  Constitution has been revised four times, most recently in 1953. The  seat of government is in the capital of Copenhagen. Denmark exercises  hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving political powers to  handle internal affairs. Denmark became a member of the European Union  in 1973, maintaining four opt-outs from European Union policies, as  outlined in the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement. Both the Faroe Islands and  Greenland remain outside the Union.The unified kingdom of Denmark  emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the  struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark was part of the Kalmar  Union, established in 1397, ended with Swedish secession in 1523. The  following year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway, which lasted  nearly three centuries until its dissolution in 1814. Beginning in the  17th century, there were several cessions of Danish territory; these  culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements, which  were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral  during World War I. In April 1940, Denmark was invaded by Germany with  brief, military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was  active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. Denmark joined  NATO in 1949, relinquishing its historically neutral stance. An  industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of  the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in  the early decades of the 20th century, making the basis for the present  welfare state with a highly developed mixed market economy. The Danish  krone has been pegged to the euro since 1 January 1999.Denmark is  frequently ranked as the happiest country in the world in cross-national  studies of happiness. Denmark ranks as having the world's highest  social mobility, a high level of income equality, has one of the world's  highest per capita income, and has one of the world's highest personal  income tax rates.

It is  bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and  Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the  Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden at the east. Djibouti occupies a total area  of just 23,200 km2 (8,958 sq mi).In antiquity, the territory was part  of the Land of Punt. Nearby Zeila (now in Somalia) was the seat of the  medieval Adal and Ifat Sultanates. In the late 19th century, the colony  of French Somaliland was established following treaties signed by the  ruling Somali and Afar sultans with the French and its railroad to Dire  Dawa (and later Addis Ababa) allowed it to quickly supersede Zeila as  the port for southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden. It was subsequently  renamed to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas in 1967. A  decade later, the Djiboutian people voted for independence. This  officially marked the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti, named  after its capital city. Djibouti joined the United Nations the same  year, on September 20, 1977. In the early 1990s, tensions over  government representation led to armed conflict, which ended in a power  sharing agreement in 2000 between the ruling party and the  opposition.Djibouti is a multi-ethnic nation with a population of over  810,000 inhabitants.

The Commonwealth of Dominica had a  population of 71,293 at the 2011 Census. The capital is Roseau which is  located on the leeward side of the island.Dominica has been nicknamed  the ""Nature Isle of the Caribbean"" for its unspoiled natural beauty. It  is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by  geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest  hot spring, Boiling Lake. The island features lush mountainous  rainforests, home of many rare plant, animal, and bird species. There  are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy  rainfall can be expected inland. Dominica is the only country in the  world with a count of 365 rivers.[citation needed] The Sisserou Parrot  (also known as the Imperial Amazon), is found only on the Caribbean  Island of Dominica and is the island's national bird. It is featured on  the national flag.

In the hundred years after Columbus's landing, Dominica  remained isolated. More Caribs settled there after being driven from  surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region. France had a  colony for several years, importing African slaves to work on its  plantations. In this period, the Antillean Creole language developed.  France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763.  Great Britain established a small colony on the island in 1805.Britain  emancipated slaves throughout the British Empire in 1834. By 1838,  Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a legislature  controlled by an ethnic African majority. In 1896, the United Kingdom  took governmental control of Dominica, turning it into a Crown colony.

Christopher Columbus landed on the island in  1492, and it became the site of the first permanent European settlement  in the Americas, namely Santo Domingo, the country's capital and Spain's  first capital in the New World. After three centuries of Spanish rule,  with French and Haitian interludes, the country became independent in  1821. The ruler, José Núñez de Cáceres, intended that the Dominican  Republic be part of the nation of Gran Colombia, but he was quickly  removed by the Haitian government and ""Dominican"" slave revolts.  Victorious in the Dominican War of Independence in 1844, Dominicans  experienced mostly internal strife over the next 72 years, and also a  brief return to Spanish rule. The United States occupation of 1916–1924,  and a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio  Vásquez Lajara, were followed by the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas  Trujillo Molina until 1961. The civil war of 1965, the country's last,  was ended by a U.S.-led intervention, and was followed by the  authoritarian rule of Joaquín Balaguer, 1966–1978. Since then, the  Dominican Republic has moved toward representative democracy, and has  been led by Leonel Fernández for most of the time after 1996. Danilo  Medina, the Dominican Republic's current president, succeeded Fernández  in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent  ex-president Hipólito Mejía.The Dominican Republic has the ninth largest  economy in Latin America and the second largest economy in the  Caribbean and Central American region. Though long known for agriculture  and mining, the economy is now dominated by services. The country's  economic progress is exemplified by its advanced telecommunication  system, and transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, unemployment,  government corruption, and inconsistent electric service remain major  Dominican problems. The country also has ""marked income inequality"".  International migration affects the Dominican Republic greatly, as it  receives and sends large flows of migrants. Haitian immigration and the  integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues. A large  Dominican diaspora exists, mostly in the United States. They contribute  to national development as they send billions of dollars to their  families.The Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the  Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are among the top attractions on  the island. As one of the region's most geographically diverse  countries, the Dominican Republic boasts the Caribbean's highest  mountain peak, Pico Duarte, as well as the Caribbean's largest lake and  lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature  of 26 °C (78.8 °F) and great biological diversity. The country is also  home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of  the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, an area declared  as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread  across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and  other major cities in the Nile Delta.Egypt has one of the longest  histories of any modern state, having been continuously inhabited since  the 10th millennium BC. Its monuments, such as the Giza Necropolis and  its Great Sphinx, were constructed by its ancient civilization, which  was one of the most powerful of its time and one of the first six  civilizations to arise independently in the world. Its ancient ruins,  such as those of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings  outside Luxor, are a significant focus of archaeological study and  popular interest from around the world. Egypt's rich cultural legacy, as  well as the attraction of its Red Sea Riviera, have made tourism a  vital part of the economy, employing about 12 percent of the country's  workforce.The economy of Egypt is one of the most diversified in the  Middle East, with sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and  services at almost equal production levels. Egypt is considered to be a  regional and middle power, with significant cultural, political, and  military influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim  world.""@en"

It has two parts, an  insular and a mainland region. The insular region consists of the  islands of Bioko (formerly Fernando Pó) in the Gulf of Guinea and  Annobón, a small volcanic island south of the equator. Bioko Island is  the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea and is the site of the  country's capital, Malabo. The island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe is  located between Bioko and Annobón. The mainland region, Río Muni, is  bordered by Cameroon on the north and Gabon on the south and east. It  also includes several small offshore islands (such as Corisco, Elobey  Grande, and Elobey Chico).Formerly the colony of Spanish Guinea, its  post-independence name evokes its location near both the equator and the  Gulf of Guinea. Apart from the Spanish territories of Canary Islands,  Ceuta and Melilla on the coast of Morocco, and Sahrawi Arab Democratic  Republic (a.k.a.

With its capital at Asmara, it is bordered by Sudan to the  west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east. The northeastern  and eastern parts of Eritrea have an extensive coastline along the Red  Sea, across from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The nation has a total area of  approximately 117,600 km2 (45,406 sq mi), and includes the Dahlak  Archipelago and several of the Hanish Islands.Eritrea is a multi-ethnic  country, with nine recognized ethnic groups. It has a population of  around six million inhabitants. Most residents speak Afro-Asiatic  languages, either of the Semitic or Cushitic branches. Among these  communities, the Tigrinya make up about 55% of the population, with the  Tigre constituting around 30% of inhabitants. In addition, there are a  number of Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nilotic ethnic minorities. Most people  in the territory adhere to Christianity or Islam.The Kingdom of Aksum,  covering much of modern-day Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, rose  somewhere around the first or second centuries and adopted Christianity  by the time Islam had conquered Egypt. In medieval times much of Eritrea  fell under the Medri Bahri Kingdom, with a smaller region being part of  the Hamasien Republic. The creation of modern day Eritrea is a result  of the incorporation of independent Kingdoms and various vassal states  of the Ethiopian empire and the Ottoman Empire, eventually resulting in  the formation of Italian Eritrea. In 1947 Eritrea gained its  independence from European powers and became part of a federation with  Ethiopia, the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea.

It is bordered by Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti  and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to  the south. With over 93,000,000 inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most  populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most  populated nation on the African continent. It occupies a total area of  1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest  city is Addis Ababa.Some of the oldest evidence for modern humans is  found in Ethiopia, which is widely considered the region from which Homo  sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. Tracing  its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of  its history. Alongside Rome, Persia, China and India, the Kingdom of  Aksum was one of the great world powers of the 3rd century. In the 4th  century, it was the first major empire in the world to officially adopt  Christianity as a state religion.Ethiopia derived prestige for its  uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century  Scramble for Africa, and subsequently many African nations adopted the  colors of Ethiopia's flag following their independence. Ethiopia was the  only African country to defeat a European colonial power and retain its  sovereignty as an independent country. It was the first independent  African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the UN. In  1974, at the end of Haile Selassie I's reign, power fell to a communist  military junta known as the Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it  was defeated by the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the  collapse of the USSR in 1991.Ethiopia is a multilingual society with  around 80 ethnic groups, with the two largest being the Oromo and the  Amhara. It is the origin of the coffee bean. Ethiopia is a land of  natural contrasts; with its vast fertile West, jungles, and numerous  rivers, the World's hottest settlement in its north, Africa's largest  continuous mountain ranges and the largest cave in Africa at Sof Omar.  Ethiopia has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Ethiopia's  ancient Ge'ez script, also known as Ethiopic, is one of the oldest  alphabets still in use in the world. The Ethiopian calendar, which is  seven years and about three months behind the Gregorian calendar,  co-exists alongside the Oromo calendar. The majority of the population  is Christian and a third is Muslim; the country is the site of the first  Hijra in Islamic history and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa at  Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta  Israel, resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s but most of them have since  gradually emigrated to Israel. Ethiopia is also the spiritual homeland  of the Rastafari movement, which globalized its flag colors worldwide  via pop culture and Reggae music.Ethiopia is one of the founding members  of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, G-77 and  the Organisation of African Unity, with Addis Ababa serving as the  headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce  and Industry, the UNECA, the African Standby Force and much of global  NGOs focused on Africa. Despite being the main source of the Nile, the  longest river on earth, Ethiopia underwent a series of famines in the  1980s, exacerbated by civil wars and adverse geopolitics.

In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in  Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in  the capital of Helsinki, local governments in 336 municipalities and an  autonomous region, the Åland Islands. About one million residents live  in the Greater Helsinki area (consisting of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and  Kauniainen), which also produces a third of the country's GDP. Other  large cities include Tampere, Turku, Oulu, Jyväskylä, Lahti, and  Kuopio.From the 12th until the early 19th century, Finland was part of  Sweden, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and  its official status. It then became an autonomous Grand Duchy within  the Russian Empire until the Russian Revolution, which prompted the  Finnish Declaration of Independence. This was followed by a civil war  where the pro-Bolshevik ""Reds"" were defeated by the pro-conservative  ""Whites"" with support from the German Empire. After a brief attempt to  establish a monarchy, Finland became a republic. Finland's experience of  World War II involved three separate conflicts: the Winter War  (1939–1940) and Continuation War (1941–1944) against the Soviet Union  and the Lapland War (1944–1945) against Nazi Germany. Following the end  of the war, Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an  official policy of neutrality.

The  kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia adopted Christianity in the early 4th  century. A unified Kingdom of Georgia reached the peak of its political  and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar  in the 11th–12th centuries. At the beginning of the 19th century,  Georgia was annexed by the Russian Empire. After a brief period of  independence following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia was  occupied by Soviet Russia in 1921, becoming the Georgian Soviet  Socialist Republic and part of the Soviet Union. After independence in  1991, post-communist Georgia suffered from civil unrest and economic  crisis for most of the 1990s. This lasted until the Rose Revolution of  2003, after which the new government introduced democratic and economic  reforms.Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe and the GUAM  Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. It contains two de  facto independent regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which gained  limited international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.  Georgia and a major part of the international community consider the  regions to be part of Georgia's sovereign territory under Russian  military occupation.""@en"
"""Germany""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany,"""Germany (/ˈdʒɜrməni/; German: Deutschland), officially the  Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland,  pronounced [ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant] ), is a federal parliamentary  republic in western-central Europe. The country consists of 16 states  and its capital and largest city is Berlin. Germany covers an area of  357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi) and has a largely temperate  seasonal climate. With 80.6 million inhabitants, it is the most populous  member state in the European Union. Germany is the major economic and  political power of the European continent and a historic leader in many  cultural, theoretical and technical fields.Various Germanic tribes  occupied what is now northern Germany and southern Scandinavia since  classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented by the  Romans before AD 100. During the Migration Period that coincided with  the decline of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes expanded southward  and established kingdoms throughout much of Europe. Beginning in the  10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman  Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the  centre of the Protestant Reformation. Occupied during the Napoleonic  Wars, the rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted  in the unification of most of the German states in 1871 into the German  Empire, which was dominated by Prussia.After the German Revolution of  1918–1919 and the subsequent military surrender in World War I, the  Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic in 1918, with  some of its territory partitioned in the Treaty of Versailles. Despite  its lead in many scientific and cultural fields at this time, Germany  nonetheless endured significant economic and political instability,  which intensified during the Great Depression and contributed to the  establishment of the Third Reich in 1933. The subsequent rise of fascism  led to World War II. After 1945, Germany was divided by allied  occupation, and evolved into two states, East Germany and West Germany.  In 1990, the country was reunified.Germany has the world's  fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by  purchasing power parity. As a global leader in several industrial and  technological sectors, it is the second-largest exporter and  third-largest importer of goods. It is a developed country with a very  high standard of living, featuring comprehensive social security that  includes the world's oldest universal health care system. Known for its  rich cultural and political history, Germany has been the home of many  influential philosophers, music composers, scientists, and inventors.  Germany was a founding member of the European Community in 1957, which  became the EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and has been a  member of the eurozone since 1999.

According to the  2011 census, Greece's population is around 11 million. Athens is the  nation's capital and largest city.Greece is strategically located at the  crossroads of Europe, Western Asia, and Africa, and shares land borders  with Albania to the northwest, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria  to the north and Turkey to the northeast. The country consists of nine  geographic regions: Macedonia, Central Greece, the Peloponnese,  Thessaly, Epirus, the Aegean Islands (including the Dodecanese and  Cyclades), Thrace, Crete, and the Ionian Islands. The Aegean Sea lies to  the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, and the  Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the  Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at  13,676 km (8,498 mi) in length, featuring a vast number of islands  (approximately 1,400, of which 227 are inhabited). Eighty percent of  Greece consists of mountains, of which Mount Olympus is the highest, at  2,917 m (9,570 ft).Modern Greece traces its roots to the civilization of  Ancient Greece, which began with the Aegean Civilizations of the Bronze  Age. Considered the cradle of all Western civilization, Greece is the  birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, the Olympic Games, Western  literature and historiography, political science, major scientific and  mathematical principles, and Western drama, including both tragedy and  comedy. The cultural and technological achievements of Greece greatly  influenced the world, with many aspects of Greek civilization being  imparted to the East through Alexander the Great's campaigns, and to the  West through its incorporation into the Roman Empire. This rich legacy  is partly reflected by the 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in  Greece, ranking it 6th in Europe and 13th in the world.

The country's capital and largest  city is Budapest. Hungary is a member of the European Union, NATO, the  OECD, the Visegrád Group, and the Schengen Area. The official language  is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language  in Europe.Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts,  Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was  laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád in the  Honfoglalás (""homeland-conquest""). His great-grandson Stephen I ascended  to the throne in 1000 AD, converting the country to a Christian  kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the  Western world. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Medieval Hungary  collapsed and succumbed to 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation  (1541–1699). Hungary eventually came under Habsburg rule, and later  formed a significant part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire  (1867–1918).Hungary's current borders were first established by the  Treaty of Trianon (1920) after World War I, when the country lost 71% of  its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians.  Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World  War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Hungary came under  the influence of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the  establishment of a four-decade long communist dictatorship (1947–1989).  The country gained widespread international attention regarding the  Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted  border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the  Eastern Bloc.On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic  parliamentary republic, and is recognized today as a developed country.

Others had visited the island earlier and stayed  over winter. During the following centuries, Norsemen settled Iceland,  bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. From 1262 to 1918, Iceland  was part of the Norwegian and later the Danish monarchies. The country  became independent in 1918 and a republic was declared in 1944.Until the  20th century, the Icelanders relied largely on fishing and agriculture,  and the country was one of the least developed in the region.  Industrialisation of the fisheries and aid through the United States'  Marshall Plan following World War II brought prosperity and, by the  1990s, Iceland had developed as one of the wealthiest and most developed  nations in the world. In 1994, Iceland became party to the European  Economic Area, which supported diversification of the economy into  economic and financial services. In 2008, affected by the worldwide  crisis, the nation's entire banking system systemically failed,  resulting in substantial political unrest. In the wake of the crisis,  Iceland instituted ""capital controls"" that made it impossible for many  foreigners to get their money out of the country, causing a dispute with  foreign investors. The economy has since then made a significant  recovery.Iceland has a free-market economy with relatively low taxes  compared to other OECD countries. It maintains a Nordic social welfare  system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for  its citizens. Iceland ranks high in economic, political and social  stability and equality. In 2013, it was ranked as the 13th  most-developed country in the world by the United Nations' Human  Development Index.Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation's Norse  heritage. Most Icelanders are descendants of Norse and Gaelic settlers.  Icelandic, a North Germanic language, is descended from Old Norse and is  closely related to Faroese and some West Norwegian dialects. The  country's cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine,  poetry, and the medieval Icelanders' sagas. Among NATO members, Iceland  has the smallest population and is the only one with no standing army.  Its lightly armed Coast Guard is in charge of its defences.""@en"

It shares land borders with Lebanon in the north,  Syria in the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories  (or State of Palestine) comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip on the  east and southwest respectively, Egypt and the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red  Sea to the south, and it contains geographically diverse features within  its relatively small area. In its Basic Laws Israel defines itself as a  Jewish and Democratic State; it is the world's only Jewish-majority  state.On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly  recommended the adoption and implementation of the partition plan of  Mandatory Palestine. On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the Executive  Head of the World Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish  Agency for Palestine, declared ""the establishment of a Jewish state in  Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,"" a state independent  upon the termination of the British Mandate for Palestine, 15 May 1948.  Neighboring Arab armies invaded Palestine on the next day and fought the  Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring  Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai  Peninsula (between 1967 and 1982), part of South Lebanon (between 1982  and 2000), Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It annexed portions of  these territories, including East Jerusalem, but the border with the  West Bank is disputed. Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and  Jordan, but efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have so  far not resulted in peace.Israel's financial center is Tel Aviv, while  Jerusalem is the country's most populous city and its designated  capital, though internationally Jerusalem is not considered to be a part  of Israel.Ethnic groups in Israel include Mizrahi Jews, Ashkenazi Jews,  Palestinians, Sephardi Jews, Yemenite Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Bedouin,  Druze, and many other groups. The population of Israel, as defined by  the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, was estimated in 2014 to be  8,146,300 people, of whom 6,110,600 are Jewish, a large proportion of  whom come from mixed ethnic heritage. The country's second largest group  are designated as Arabs, with 1,686,000 people (including the Druze and  most East Jerusalem Arabs). The great majority of Israeli Arabs are  settled Muslims, with smaller but significant numbers of semi-settled  Negev Bedouins; the rest are Christians and Druze. Other minorities  include Maronites, Samaritans, Black Hebrew Israelites, other  Sub-Saharan Africans, Armenians, Circassians, Roma and others. Israel  also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and  asylum seekers from Africa and Asia.Israel is a representative democracy  with a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal  suffrage.

"""Italy""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy,"""Italy /ˈɪtəli/ (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja]), officially the  Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica italiana), is a unitary  parliamentary republic in Southern Europe. To the north, Italy borders  France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, and is approximately  delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the  Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian  Peninsula and the two biggest Mediterranean islands of Sicily and  Sardinia.Italian territory also includes the islands of Pantelleria, 60  km (37 mi) east of the Tunisian coast and 100 km (62 mi) southwest of  Sicily, and Lampedusa, at about 113 km (70 mi) from Tunisia and at 176  km (109 mi) from Sicily, in addition to many other smaller islands. The  sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within  Italy, while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.  Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely  temperate climate. With 60 million inhabitants, it is the 5th most  populous country in Europe. Italy is also the 4th-largest economy in the  European Union, 3rd in the Eurozone and 9th in the world (IMF,  2012).Italy's capital and largest city, Rome, has for centuries been the  leading political and religious centre of Western civilisation, serving  as the capital of both the Roman Empire and Christianity. During the  Dark Ages, Italy endured cultural and social decline in the face of  repeated invasions by Germanic tribes, with Roman heritage being  preserved largely by Christian monks. Beginning around the 11th century,  various Italian cities, communes and maritime republics rose to great  prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking (indeed, modern  capitalism has its roots in Medieval Italy); concurrently, Italian  culture flourished, especially during the Renaissance, which produced  many notable scholars, artists, and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci,  Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. Meanwhile, Italian explorers  such as Polo, Columbus, Vespucci, and Verrazzano discovered new routes  to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age  of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy would remain fragmented into numerous  warring states for the rest of the Middle Ages, subsequently falling  prey to larger European powers such as France, Spain, and later Austria.  Italy would thus enter a long period of decline that lasted until the  beginning of the 18th century.After many unsuccessful attempts, the  second and the third wars of Italian independence resulted in the  unification of most of present-day Italy between 1859 and 1866. From the  late 19th century to the early 20th century, the new Kingdom of Italy  rapidly industrialized and acquired a colonial empire becoming a Great  Power. However, Southern and rural Italy remained largely excluded from  industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora. Despite  victory in World War I as one of the Big Four with permanent membership  in the security council of the League of Nations, Italy entered a period  of economic crisis and social turmoil, which favoured the establishment  of a Fascist dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in  World War II, at the side of Nazi Germany and Japan forming the Axis  Alliance, ended in military defeat, economic destruction and civil war.

It is  bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south.  Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the  Arabian hinterland has dictated its rich history and shaped a cultural  identity of religious and ethnic diversity.The earliest evidence of  civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years,  predating recorded history. Lebanon was the home of the Phoenicians, a  maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years (c. 1550–539  BC). In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire, and  eventually became one of the Empire's leading centers of Christianity.  In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite  Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the  Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new  religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount Lebanon as  well, a religious divide that would last for centuries. During the  Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic  Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established  with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era.The  region eventually came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, a political  empire that which came to power from 1299-1923. Following the collapse  of the Empire after World War I, the five provinces that constitute  modern Lebanon were mandated to France. The French expanded the borders  of Mount Lebanon, which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze, to  include more Muslims. Lebanon gained independence in 1943, establishing a  unique political system – ""confessionalism"" – that is a power-sharing  mechanism based on religious communities. Bechara El Khoury (independent  Lebanon's first president), Riad El-Solh (Lebanon's first prime  minister) and Emir Majid Arslan (Lebanon's first minister of defence)  are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are  national heroes for having led the country's independence. French troops  withdrew from Lebanon in 1946.Before the Lebanese Civil War  (1975–1990), the country experienced a period of relative calm and  renowned prosperity, driven by tourism, agriculture, commerce, and  banking. Because of its financial power and diversity, Lebanon was known  in its heyday as ""the Switzerland of the East"". It attracted so many  tourists that the capital, Beirut, was referred to as ""the Paris of the  Middle East"". At the end of the war, there were extensive efforts to  revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure.""@en"

Its coastline is composed mostly of  mangroves, while its more sparsely populated inland consists of forests  opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is hot and  equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy  season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. The country  possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean  rainforest.Liberia is the only country in Africa founded by United  States colonization while occupied by native Africans. Beginning in  1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were  freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as  Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the  American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders  thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African  captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent  there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin. In  1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a  government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital  city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United  States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and  their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political,  social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the  nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.The country began to  modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during  World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman.  Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the  Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the  Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and  economic instability and two successive civil wars. These resulted in  the deaths of between 250,000 and 520,000 people and devastated the  country's economy. A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections  in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the  civil wars and their consequent economic upheaval, but about 85% of the  population continue to live below the international poverty line.""@en"

In the 1230s the  Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, and  the first unified Lithuanian state, the Kingdom of Lithuania, was  created on 6 July 1253. During the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of  Lithuania was the largest country in Europe: present-day Lithuania,  Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were the territories of  the Grand Duchy. With the Lublin Union of 1569, Lithuania and Poland  formed a voluntary two-state union, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighboring  countries systematically dismantled it from 1772–95, with the Russian  Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory.As World War I neared its  end, Lithuania's Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918,  declaring the establishment of a sovereign State of Lithuania.

It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the  northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is  separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over  118,000 km2 (45,560 sq mi) with an estimated population of 16,777,547  (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's  largest city; the second largest is Blantyre and the third is Mzuzu. The  name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people  that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed ""The Warm Heart of  Africa"".The area of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating  Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area  was colonized by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as Nyasaland,  became part of the semi-independent central African Federation (CAF).  The Federation was dissolved in 1963 and in 1964, Nyasaland gained full  independence and was renamed Malawi. Upon gaining independence it became  a single-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who  remained president until 1994, when he was ousted from power. Joyce  Banda (no relation) is the current president, raised to that position  after president Bingu wa Mutharika died in 2012. She is the first female  president in Malawi. (see also Rose Chibambo for examples of women  political leaders in Malawi). Malawi has a democratic, multi-party  government. Malawi has a small military force that includes an army, a  navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is pro-Western and  includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and  participation in several international organisations.Malawi is among the  world's least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in  agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian government  depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this  need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian  government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy,  improving education, health care, environmental protection, and becoming  financially independent. Malawi has several programs developed since  2005 that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be  improving, with improvements in economic growth, education and  healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.Malawi has a low life expectancy and  high infant mortality. There is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which is a  drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a  diverse population of native peoples, Asians and Europeans, with several  languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was  periodic regional conflict fueled in part by ethnic divisions in the  past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a  Malawian nationality had reemerged.

During its golden age, there was a flourishing of  mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, Mali  covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France, and stretched  to the west coast of Africa.

Geographically, the country is  part of the larger island group of Micronesia, with the population of  68,480 people spread out over 24 low-lying coral atolls, comprising  1,156 individual islands and islets. The islands share maritime  boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake  Island to the north, Kiribati to the south-east, and Nauru to the south.  The most populous atoll is Majuro, which also acts as the  capital.Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands  during the 2nd millennium BC, with inter-island navigation made possible  using traditional stick charts. Islands in the archipelago were first  explored by Europeans in the 1520s, with Spanish explorer Alonso de  Salazar sighting an atoll in August 1526. Other expeditions by Spanish  and English ships followed, with the islands' current name stemming from  British explorer John Marshall. Recognised as part of the Spanish East  Indies in 1874, the islands were sold to Germany in 1884, and became  part of German New Guinea in 1885. The Empire of Japan occupied the  Marshall Islands in World War I, which were later joined with other  former German territories in 1919 by the League of Nations to form the  South Pacific Mandate. In World War II, the islands were conquered by  the United States in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Along  with other Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands were then consolidated  into the United-States-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.  Self-government was achieved in 1979, and full sovereignty in 1986,  under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.Politically,  the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with  the United States, with the US providing defense, funding grants, and  access to social services. Having few natural resources, the islands'  wealth is based on a service economy, as well as some fishing and  agriculture, with a large percentage of the islands' gross domestic  product coming from United States aid. The country uses the United  States dollar as its currency. The majority of citizens of the Marshall  Islands are of Marshallese descent, with small numbers of immigrants  from the Philippines and other Pacific islands. The two official  languages are Marshallese, a member of the Malayo-Polynesian languages,  and English. Almost the entire population of the islands practises some  religion, with three-quarters of the country either following the United  Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands (UCCCMI) or  the Assemblies of God.""@en"

It is bordered on  the north by the United States of America; on the south and west by the  Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean  Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million  square kilometres (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the fifth largest  country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent  nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 113 million,  it is the eleventh most populous and the most populous Spanish-speaking  country in the world and the second most populous country in Latin  America. Mexico is a federation comprising thirty-one states and a  Federal District, the capital city.In pre-Columbian Mexico many cultures  matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec, the Toltec, the  Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, the Maya and the Aztec before first contact  with Europeans. In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the  territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered  as the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This territory would eventually become  Mexico following recognition of the colony's independence in 1821. The  post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, the  Mexican-American War that led to the territorial cession to the United  States, the Pastry War, the Franco-Mexican War, a civil war, two empires  and a domestic dictatorship. The latter led to the Mexican Revolution  in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution  and the emergence of the country's current political system. In March  1938, through the Mexican oil expropriation private U.S. and Anglo-Dutch  oil companies were nationalized to create the state-owned Pemex oil  company.Mexico has one of the world's largest economies, it is the tenth  largest oil producer in the world, the largest silver producer in the  world and is considered both a regional power and middle power. In  addition, Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD (since 1994), and  considered an upper-middle income country by the World Bank. Mexico is  considered a newly industrialized country and an emerging power. It has  the fourteenth largest nominal GDP and the tenth largest GDP by  purchasing power parity. The economy is strongly linked to those of its  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, especially the  United States of America. Mexico ranks sixth in the world and first in  the Americas by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites with 32, and in  2010 was the tenth most visited country in the world with 22.5 million  international arrivals per year. According to Goldman Sachs, by 2050  Mexico is expected to become the world's fifth largest economy.  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimated in January 2013 that by 2050  Mexico could be the world's seventh largest economy.

Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its  defense is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain  two small military units.Economic development was spurred in the late  19th century with the opening of its first casino, Monte Carlo, and a  railway connection to Paris. Since then, the principality's mild  climate, splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to  Monaco's status as a premier tourist destination and recreation center  for the rich and famous. However, in more recent years Monaco has become  a major banking center and has successfully sought to diversify its  economy into the services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting  industries.

It is separated from  Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and  largest city is Maputo (previously called Lourenço Marques before  independence).Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, Bantu-speaking  peoples migrated from farther north and west. Swahili, and later also  Arab, commercial ports existed along the coasts until the arrival of  Europeans. The area was explored by Vasco da Gama in 1498 and colonized  by Portugal from 1505. After over four centuries of Portuguese rule,  Mozambique gained independence in 1975, becoming the People's Republic  of Mozambique shortly thereafter. After only two years of independence,  the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting  from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first multiparty  elections and has remained a relatively stable presidential republic  since.Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources.  The country's economy is based largely on agriculture, but with  industry, mainly food and beverages, chemical manufacturing, aluminium  and petroleum production, is growing. The country's tourism sector is  also growing. South Africa is Mozambique's main trading partner and  source of foreign direct investment. Portugal, Brazil, Spain and Belgium  are also among the country's most important economic partners. Since  2001, Mozambique's annual average GDP growth has been among the world's  highest. However, the country ranks among the lowest in GDP per capita,  human development, measures of inequality, and average life  expectancy.The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese, which  is spoken mostly as a second language by about half of the population.  Common native languages include Swahili, Makhuwa, and Sena. The  country's population of around 24 million is composed overwhelmingly of  Bantu people. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity, with  significant minorities following Islam and African traditional  religions. Mozambique is a member of the African Union, Commonwealth of  Nations, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, the Latin  Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Southern African  Development Community and an observer at La Francophonie.""@en"

It shares land borders with Angola and Zambia to the north,  Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it  does not border Zimbabwe, less than 200 metres of riverbed (essentially  the Zambia/Botswana border) separates them at their closest points. It  gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the  Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek.  Namibia is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern  African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the  Commonwealth of Nations.The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since  early times by San, Damara, and Namaqua, and since about the 14th  century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion. Most  of the territory became a German Imperial protectorate in 1884 and  remained a German colony until the end of World War I. In 1920, the  League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed  its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy. The port of Walvis Bay  and the offshore Penguin Islands had been annexed by the Cape Colony  under the British crown by 1878 and had become an integral part of the  new Union of South Africa at its creation in 1910.Uprisings and demands  by African leaders led the UN to assume direct responsibility over the  territory. It recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation  (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people in 1973.  Namibia, however, remained under South African administration during  this time as South-West Africa. Following internal violence, South  Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia  obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990, with the exception  of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands, which remained under South  African control until 1994.Namibia has a population of 2.1 million  people and a stable multi-party parliamentary democracy. Agriculture,  herding, tourism and the mining industry – including mining for gem  diamonds, uranium, gold, silver, and base metals – form the backbone of  Namibia's economy.

New Zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres (900 mi)  east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres  (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and  Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be  settled by humans. During its long isolation, New Zealand developed a  distinctive biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life; most notable  are the large number of unique bird species. The country's varied  topography and its sharp mountain peaks owe much to the tectonic uplift  of land and volcanic eruptions.Polynesians settled New Zealand in  1250–1300 CE and developed a distinctive Māori culture. Abel Tasman, a  Dutch explorer, was the first European to sight New Zealand in 1642 CE.  The introduction of potatoes and muskets triggered upheaval among Māori  early during the 19th century, which led to the inter-tribal Musket  Wars. In 1840 the British Crown and Māori signed the Treaty of Waitangi,  making New Zealand a British colony. Immigrant numbers increased  sharply and conflicts escalated into the New Zealand Wars, which  resulted in Māori land being confiscated in the mid North Island.  Economic depressions were followed by periods of political reform, with  women gaining the vote during the 1890s, and a welfare state being  established from the 1930s. After World War II, New Zealand joined  Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty, although  the United States later suspended the treaty as a result of New  Zealand's adoption of a nuclear-free policy. New Zealanders enjoyed one  of the highest standards of living in the world in the 1950s, but the  1970s saw a deep recession, worsened by oil shocks and the United  Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community. The country  underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it  from a protectionist to a liberalised free trade economy; once-dominant  exports of wool have been overtaken by dairy products, meat, and  wine.The majority of New Zealand's population is of European descent;  the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and  Pacific Islanders. English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the  official languages, with English predominant. Much of New Zealand's  culture is derived from Māori and early British settlers. Early European  art was dominated by landscapes and to a lesser extent portraits of  Māori.

The capital city is Niamey,  located in the far-southwest corner of Niger.Niger is a developing  country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United  Nations' Human Development Index (HDI); it was ranked 186th of 186  countries for 2012. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are  threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is  concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in  the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially  uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its  landlocked position, desert terrain, poor education and poverty of its  people, lack of infrastructure, poor health care, and environmental  degradation.Nigerien (/niːˈʒɛəriən/) society reflects a diversity drawn  from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and  regions and their relatively short period living in a single state.

Its coast in the  south lies on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean.Long the site of  numerous kingdoms and empires, the modern state of Nigeria has its  origins in the British colonization of the region during the late  nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, emerging from the combination  of two neighboring British protectorates: (the Southern Nigeria  Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate). The British set up  administrative and legal structures while retaining traditional  chiefdoms. Nigeria became independent in 1960, but plunged into civil  war several years later. It has since alternated between  democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships,  with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be  conducted reasonably free and fair.Nigeria is often referred to as the  ""the Giant of Africa"", due to its large population and economy.

"""North Korea""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Korea,"""North Korea (About this sound listen), officially the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK; Chosŏn'gŭl: 조선민주주의인민공화국;  Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk), is a country in East Asia, in the  northern part of the Korean Peninsula. The name Korea is derived from  Goryeo, a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. The capital and  largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China  to the north and north-west, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers. A  small section of the Tumen River also forms North Korea's short border  with Russia to the northeast. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the  boundary between North Korea and South Korea. The legitimacy of this  border is not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the  legitimate government of the entire peninsula.The Korean Peninsula was  governed by the Korean Empire from the late 19th century to the early  20th century, until it was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After  the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Japanese rule  ceased. The Korean Peninsula was divided into two occupied zones in  1945, with the northern part of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet  Union and the southern portion by the United States. A United  Nations-supervised election held in 1948 led to the creation of separate  Korean governments for the two occupation zones: the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in  the south. The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War  in 1950. An armistice in 1953 committed both to a cease-fire, but the  two countries remain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was  never signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in  1991.Although the DPRK officially describes itself as a Juche  Korean-style socialist republic and elections are held, it is widely  considered a dictatorship that has been described as totalitarian and  Stalinist with an elaborate cult of personality around the Kim family.  The Workers' Party of Korea, led by a member of the ruling family, holds  de facto power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are  required to be a member. Juche, an ideology of self-reliance initiated  by the country's first President, Kim Il-sung, became the official state  ideology, replacing Marxism–Leninism, when the country adopted a new  constitution in 1972. In 2009, references to Communism (Chosŏn'gŭl:  공산주의) were removed from the country's constitution.The means of  production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and  collectivized farms, and most services such as healthcare, education,  housing and food production are state funded or subsidized. In the 1990s  North Korea suffered from a famine and continues to struggle with food  production. In 2013, the UN identified North Korean government policies  as the primary cause of the shortages and estimated that 16 million  people required food aid. North Korea's health care system has been a  subject of controversy: the World Health Organization described it as  ""the envy of the developing world"" while Amnesty International claims  that it suffers from barely functioning hospitals, poor hygiene and  epidemics.North Korea follows Songun, or ""military-first"" policy in  order to strengthen the country and its government. It is the world's  most militarized society, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and  paramilitary personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the 4th  largest in the world, after China, the U.S., and India. It is a  nuclear-weapons state and has an active space program. As a result of  its isolation, it is sometimes known as the ""hermit kingdom"". The  Economist Intelligence Unit ranked it as the lowest country in the  Democracy Index. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN's  commission on human rights in North Korea report of severe restrictions  on human rights and crimes against humanity 'without parallel in the  modern world'.

Norway has a total  area of 385,252 square kilometres (148,747 sq mi) and a population of  5,109,059 people. (01.01. 2014) It is the 2nd least densely populated  country in Europe. The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden  (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long), which is the longest uninterrupted border  within both Scandinavia & Europe at large. Norway is bordered by  Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak Strait to the  south, with Denmark on the other side. It shares maritime borders with  Russia by the Barents Sea; Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland by  the Norwegian Sea; and Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom by the  North Sea. Norway's extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean  and the Barents Sea, is laced with fjords, a renowned part of its  landscape. The capital city Oslo is the largest in the nation, with a  population of 630,000. Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum,  natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, fresh water, and hydropower.Two  centuries of Viking raids to southern and western areas tapered off  following the adoption of Christianity in AD 994. Norway expanded its  control overseas to parts of Britain, Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland.  Norwegian power peaked in 1265, but competition from the Hanseatic  League and the spread of the Black Death weakened the country. In 1380,  Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four  centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to  Sweden and adopted a constitution. Sweden went to war with Norway but  agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the  union under a Swedish king. Later Norway demanded independence, which it  gained in a referendum in 1905. Norway remained neutral in World War I.  Despite its declaration of neutrality in World War II, Norway was  occupied for 5 years by forces of Nazi Germany. In 1949 it abandoned  neutrality, becoming a founding member of NATO. Discovery of oil in  adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes.  The country maintains a welfare model with universal health care,  subsidised higher education, and a comprehensive social security system.  Key domestic issues include maintaining the country's extensive social  safety net with an aging population and preserving economic  competitiveness. The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of  the country's gross domestic product.King Harald V is Norway's head of  state and Erna Solberg became Prime Minister on 16 October 2013,  replacing Jens Stoltenberg, and the government made a shift from being a  labour to a conservative government. It has administrative subdivisions  on two levels, known as counties (fylke) and municipalities (kommuner).  The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and  influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and  the Finnmark Act. Norway maintains close ties with the European Union  and its member countries (despite rejecting full EU membership in two  referenda), as well as with the United States. Norway participates with  United Nations forces in international missions, notably in Afghanistan,  Kosovo, Sudan, and Libya. Norway is a founding member of the United  Nations, NATO, the Council of Europe, and the Nordic Council; a member  of the European Economic Area, the WTO and the OECD; and is also a part  of the Schengen Area.The country has the fourth-highest per capita  income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists, as well as  ninth-highest on a more comprehensive CIA list. On a per-capita basis,  it is the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the  Middle East, From 2001 to 2006, and then again from 2009 to 2012, Norway  had the highest Human Development Index ranking in the world. Norway  has also topped the Legatum Prosperity Index for the last five years.  The OECD ranks Norway fourth in the 2013 equalized Better Life Index and  third in intergenerational earnings elasticity. From 2010 to 2012,  Norway was classified as the most democratic country by the Democracy  Index.""@en"

Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs  through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its  central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as  Corazón de América (""Heart of America"").The indigenous Guaraní had been  living in Paraguay for at least a millennium before the Spanish  conquered the territory in the 16th century. Spanish settlers and Jesuit  missions introduced Christianity and Spanish culture to the region.  Paraguay was on the periphery of Spain's colonial empire, with few urban  centers and a sparse population. Following independence from Spain in  1811, Paraguay was ruled by a series of dictators who implemented  isolationist and protectionist policies.This development was truncated  by the disastrous Paraguayan War (1864–1870), in which the country lost  60 percent to 70 percent of its population through war and disease, and  about 140,000 square kilometers (54,054 sq mi) of territory to Argentina  and Brazil. Through the 20th century, Paraguay continued to endure a  succession of authoritarian governments, culminating in the regime of  Alfredo Stroessner, who led South America's longest-lived military  dictatorship from 1954 to 1989. He was toppled in an internal military  coup, and free multi-party elections were organized and held for the  first time in 1993. A year later, Paraguay joined Argentina, Brazil and  Uruguay to found Mercosur, a regional economic collaborative.As of 2009,  Paraguay's population was estimated to be at around 6.5 million, most  of whom are concentrated in the southeast region of the country. The  capital and largest city is Asunción, of which the metropolitan area is  home to nearly a third of Paraguay's population. In contrast to most  Latin American nations, Paraguay's indigenous language and culture,  Guaraní, remains highly influential. In each census, residents  predominantly identify as mestizo, reflecting years of intermarriage  among the different ethnic groups. Guaraní is recognized as an official  language alongside Spanish, and both languages are widely spoken in the  country, with around 92 percent of the general population speaking  Spanish and 98 percent speaking Guaraní.Paraguay has long been one of  the region's most isolated countries, although since the turn of the  21st century, it has experienced rapid economic growth.

Its capital city is Manila  while its most populous city is Quezon City; both are part of Metro  Manila.To the north of the Philippines across the Luzon Strait lies  Taiwan; Vietnam sits west across the South China Sea; southwest is the  island of Borneo across the Sulu Sea, and to the south the Celebes Sea  separates it from other islands of Indonesia; while to the east it is  bounded by the Philippine Sea and the island-nation of Palau. Its  location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the  Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with  abundant natural resources and some of the world's greatest  biodiversity. At approximately 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq  mi), the Philippines is the 64th-largest country in the world.With a  population of at least 99 million people, the Philippines is the  seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated  country in the world.

"""Poland""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland,"""Poland /ˈpoʊlənd/ (Polish: Polska), officially the Republic of  Poland (Polish: Rzeczpospolita Polska), is a country in Central Europe,  bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the  south; Ukraine, Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea and Kaliningrad  Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of  Poland is 312,679 square kilometres (120,726 sq mi), making it the 69th  largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a  population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous  country in the world, the sixth most populous member of the European  Union, and the most populous post-communist member of the European  Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative  subdivisions.Many historians trace the establishment of a Polish state  to 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with  that of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. The Kingdom of  Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding  political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the  Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The  Commonwealth gradually ceased to exist in the years 1772–1795, when the  Polish territory was partitioned among Prussia, the Russian Empire, and  Austria. Poland regained its independence (as the Second Polish  Republic) at the end of World War I, in 1918.Two decades later, in  September 1939, World War II started with the invasions of Poland by  Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop  Pact). More than six million Polish citizens died in the war. In 1944, a  Soviet-backed Polish provisional government was formed, which, after a  period of conflict, falsified referendum and elections, gave rise to a  satellite state of the Soviet Union, Polish Republic (Rzeczpospolita  Polska), renamed to the People's Republic of Poland (Polska  Rzeczpospolita Ludowa) in 1952. During the Revolutions of 1989, Poland's  Marxist-Leninist government was overthrown and Poland adopted a new  constitution establishing itself as a democracy under the name  Rzeczpospolita Polska, often referred to as the ""Third Polish Republic""  (III Rzeczpospolita).Despite the vast destruction the country  experienced during World War II, Poland managed to preserve much of its  cultural wealth. There are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO  World Heritage and 54 Historical Monuments and many objects of cultural  heritage. Since the end of the communist period, Poland has achieved a  ""very high"" ranking in terms of human development.""@en"

It is located in  South-Western Europe, on the Iberian Peninsula, and it is the  westernmost country of mainland Europe, being bordered by the Atlantic  Ocean to the west and south and by Spain to the north and east. Aside  from continental Portugal, the Portuguese Republic holds sovereignty  over the Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira, which are  autonomous regions of Portugal. The country is named after its second  largest city, Porto, whose name derives from Latin Portus and Celtic  Cale.The land within the borders of the current Portuguese Republic has  been continually fought over and settled since prehistoric times. The  Celts and the Romans, followed by the Visigothic and Suebian domination,  and the Moorish invaders, who were eventually expelled during the  Reconquista.Portugal by 1139 established itself as an independent  kingdom from Galicia. In the 15th and 16th centuries, as the result of  pioneering the Age of Discovery, Portugal expanded western influence and  established the first global empire, becoming one of the world's major  economic, political and military powers, and ultimately dividing the  world with Spain.The Portuguese Empire was the longest-lived of the  modern European colonial empires, spanning almost 600 years, from the  capture of Ceuta in 1415 to the handover of Macau to China in 1999 (de  facto) or the granting of sovereignty to East Timor in 2002 (de jure).  The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories that are now  part of 53 different sovereign states, leaving a legacy of over 250  million Portuguese speakers today (making it the sixth most spoken first  language) and a number of Portuguese-based creoles. Portugal's  international status was greatly reduced during the 19th century,  especially following the Independence of Brazil, its largest and most  important colony. After 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy, the  democratic but unstable Portuguese First Republic was established,  itself being superseded by the ""Estado Novo"" right-wing authoritarian  regime. Democracy was restored after the Portuguese Colonial War and the  Carnation Revolution in 1974. The revolution in 1974 also resulted in  the independence of Angola, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, East  Timor, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau in 1975.Portugal is considered a  developed country with an advanced economy and high living  standards.[citation needed] It's one of the world's most globalized and  peaceful nations. It is a member of the United Nations, European Union,  Eurozone, OECD, NATO, WTO, Schengen Area, and the Community of  Portuguese Language Countries.

"""Ireland""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Ireland,"""Ireland (/ˈaɪərlənd/ or /ˈɑrlənd/; Irish: Éire, pronounced  [ˈeː.ɾʲə] ), also commonly referred to as the Republic of Ireland  (Irish: Poblacht na hÉireann), is a sovereign state in Europe occupying  about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city  is Dublin, located in the eastern part of the island, whose  metropolitan area is home to around a quarter of the country's 4.6  million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern  Ireland, one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. It is  surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south,  Saint George's Channel to the south east, and the Irish Sea to the east.  It is a unitary, parliamentary republic with an elected president  serving as head of state. The head of government, the Taoiseach, is  nominated by the lower house of parliament, Dáil Éireann.Following the  Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, Ireland  gained effective independence from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free  State in 1922. Northern Ireland exercised an option called the Ulster  Month to remain in the United Kingdom. Initially a dominion within the  British Empire (later the Commonwealth of Nations), the Free State  received official British recognition of full legislative independence  in the Statute of Westminster of 1931. A new constitution was adopted in  1937, by which the name of the state became Ireland. In 1949 the  remaining duties of the king — defined by the Executive Authority  (External Relations) Act 1936 — were removed and Ireland was declared a  republic under the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. The state had no formal  relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century, but  since 1999 the two have co-operated on a number of policy areas under  the North-South Ministerial Council created by the Good Friday  Agreement.Once one of western Europe's poorest states, modern Ireland  now ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP  per capita. After joining the European Union (then called the European  Economic Community) in 1973, Ireland enacted a series of liberal  economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth. The country  achieved considerable prosperity from 1995 to 2007, during which it  became known as the Celtic Tiger. This was halted by an unprecedented  financial crisis that began in 2008, in conjunction with the concurrent  global economic crash.Although still recovering from its economic crash,  Ireland remains one of the world's most prosperous nations. In 2011 and  2013, it was ranked as the seventh-most developed country in the world  by the United Nations Human Development Index. Ireland also performs  well in several metrics of national performance, including freedom of  the press, economic freedom and civil liberties. Ireland is a member of  the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and  the OECD. It pursues a policy of neutrality through non-alignment and  is consequently not a member of NATO, although it does participate in  Partnership for Peace.""@en"

Romania shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west,  Ukraine and Moldova to the northeast and east, and Bulgaria to the  south. At 238,391 square kilometres (92,043 sq mi), Romania is the ninth  largest country of the European Union by area, and has the 7th largest  population of the European Union with 20,121,641 people (October 2011).  Its capital and largest city is Bucharest – the 6th largest city in the  EU.The United Principalities emerged when the territories of Moldavia  and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859. In  1866 Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was called to the throne as  the Ruling Prince of the Romanian Principate and in 1881 he was finally  crowned as King Carol I, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Romania.  Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on 9 May 1877, and was  internationally recognised the following year. At the end of World War  I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of  Romania.Following the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, the  Kingdom of Romania under King Carol II officially adopted a position of  neutrality. In summer 1940, a series of territorial disputes were  resolved unfavorably to Romania, resulting in the loss of most of the  territory gained in the wake of World War I. This caused the popularity  of Romania's government to plummet. World War II gave cause to the rise  of a military dictatorship in Romania under far-right Marshal Ion  Antonescu, who chose to fight on the side of the Axis powers from  1941-44 in order to regain the provinces. After his removal, Romania  switched sides in 1944 and joined the Allies. By the end of the war,  some formerly Romanian northeastern territories were occupied by the  Soviet Union, with Red Army units stationed on Romanian soil. In 1947  Romania forcibly became a People's Republic (1947–1965) and a member of  the Warsaw Pact. In 1965 Nicolae Ceaușescu became General Secretary of  the Romanian Workers' Party, and the harsh austerity measures, political  repression, and cult of personality he implemented led to the Socialist  Republic of Romania (1965–1989) becoming the most Stalinist police  state in the Eastern bloc. Eventually his authoritarian government was  toppled in December 1989 during the Romanian Revolution.With the fall of  the Iron Curtain, Romania began its transition towards democracy and a  capitalist market economy. After a decade of post-revolution economic  problems and living-standards decline, extensive reforms fostered  economic recovery. As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle income country  with a high Human Development Index. Romania joined NATO on 29 March  2004, and the European Union on 1 January 2007.

Russia is also the world's ninth most populous  nation with 143 million people as of 2012. Extending across the entirety  of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans nine time  zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.The  nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a  recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD.  Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants,  the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted  Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis  of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the  next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller  states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and  became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde. The Grand Duchy of  Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities,  achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the  cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the  nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and  exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest  empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North  America.Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative  Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the  Soviet Union, the world's first constitutionally socialist state and a  recognized superpower, which played a decisive role in the Allied  victory in World War II. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant  technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's  first human-made satellite, and the first man in space. Following the  dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted  itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing  legal personality of the Union state.The Russian economy ranks as the  eighth largest by nominal GDP and fifth largest by purchasing power  parity. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources, the largest  reserves in the world, have made it one of the largest producers of oil  and natural gas globally.

"""Rwanda""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rwanda,"""Rwanda (/ruːˈɑːndə/ or /ruːˈændə/), officially the Republic of  Rwanda (Kinyarwanda: Repubulika y'u Rwanda; French: République du  Rwanda), is a sovereign state in central and east Africa. Located a few  degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania,  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rwanda is in the  African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography  dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with  numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate of the country is  temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons  each year.The population is young and predominantly rural, with a  density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans form three groups: the  Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descend  from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of  and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe they are  derived from former social castes, while others view them as being races  or tribes. Christianity is the largest religion in the country, the  principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with French  and English as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of  government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared  with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report  suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on  freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict  administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five  provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda has the world's  highest proportion of females in government positions in proportion to  the population.Hunter gatherers settled the territory in the stone and  iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced  first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated  from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others  militarily, centralising power, and later enacting anti-Hutu policies.  Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed  by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European  nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated pro-Tutsi policy. The  Hutu population revolted in 1959, massacring a large number of Tutsi and  ultimately establishing an independent Hutu-dominated state in 1962.  The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990,  which was followed by the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed  an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF  ended the genocide with a military victory.Rwanda's economy suffered  heavily during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, but has since strengthened.  The economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea  are the major cash crops for export. Tourism is a fast-growing sector  and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner; Rwanda is one  of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely,  and visitors are prepared to pay high prices for gorilla tracking  permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture,  particularly drums and the highly choreographed intore dance.  Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country,  including imigongo, a unique cow dung art.""@en"

It is also among the largest  producers of titanium and bauxite, a major producer of gold, and has  one of the world's largest deposits of rutile. Sierra Leone is home to  the third-largest natural harbour in the world. Despite exploitation of  this natural wealth, 70% of its people live in poverty.In 1462, the  Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra visited this area, naming it Serra  Leoa, meaning ""Lioness Mountains"", for the landscape around Freetown.  Posts in Sierra Leone were developed as centres of the Atlantic slave  trade, and hundreds of thousands of Africans were transported from the  interior to the Americas through trading posts in Sierra Leone. n the  late 18th century, the British Crown established a colony at Freetown,  for resettlements of freed slaves. About 1200 Black Loyalists were  resettled from Nova Scotia on 11 March 1792; they were mostly African  Americans from the former colonies, now the United States. Slaves  liberated from illegal trade in the early nineteenth century joined  them, and they developed the Krio people and language. In 1808, Freetown  became a British Crown colony. In 1896, Britain annexed the interior of  the country as a British protectorate, changing its relations with the  paramount chiefs.The united country achieved independence in 1961.  Competition among rival groups finally opened into the Sierra Leone  Civil War (1991 to 2002), which over more than a decade devastated the  country. It left more than 50,000 people dead, much of the country's  infrastructure destroyed, and over two million people displaced as  refugees in neighbouring countries.""@en"
"""Singapore""@en",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Singapore,"""Singapore (/ˈsɪŋəpɔər/ or /ˈsɪŋɡəpɔər/), officially the  Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign city-state and island country in  Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and  is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country's territory  consists of the lozenge-shaped main island, commonly referred to as  Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60  significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular  Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia's Riau  Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The country is highly  urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains. The country's  territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.The islands  were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a  series of local empires. Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir  Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with  permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty  over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits  Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II,  Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 and  united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from  which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of  parliament. Since then, Singapore has developed rapidly, earning  recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.Singapore is one of the  world's major commercial hubs, with the fourth-biggest financial centre  and one of the five busiest ports. Its globalised and diversified  economy depends heavily on trade, especially manufacturing, which  represented 26 percent of Singapore's GDP in 2005. In terms of  purchasing power parity, Singapore has the third-highest per capita  income in the world. It places highly in international rankings with  regard to education, healthcare, government transparency, and economic  competitiveness.Singapore is a unitary multiparty parliamentary  republic, with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary  government. The People's Action Party has won every election since  self-government began in 1959. Just over five million people live in  Singapore, of which approximately two million are foreign-born. While  Singapore is diverse, ethnic Asians predominate: 75 percent of the  population is Chinese, with significant minorities of Malays, Indians,  and Eurasians. There are four official languages, English, Malay,  Chinese, and Tamil, and the country promotes multiculturalism through a  range of official policies.One of the five founding members of the  Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore is also the  host of the APEC Secretariat, and a member of the East Asia Summit, the  Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth. Singapore's rapid  development has given it significant influence in global affairs,  leading some analysts to identify it as a middle power.""@en"

The largest city is the capital, Bratislava, and  the second largest is Košice. Slovakia is a member state of the European  Union, NATO, United Nations, OECD and WTO among others. The official  language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family.The Slavs -  ancestors of the Slovaks - arrived in the territory of present-day  Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration period. In  the 7th century, Slavs inhabiting this territory played a significant  role in the creation of Samo's Empire, historically the first Slavic  state which had its center in Western Slovakia. During the 9th century,  Slavic ancestors of the Slovaks established another political entity,  the Principality of Nitra, which later together with the Principality of  Moravia, formed Great Moravia. After the 10th century the territory of  today's Slovakia was gradually integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary,  which itself became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Habsburg  Empire. After WWI and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,  the nation of Slovaks and Czechs established their mutual state -  Czechoslovakia. A separate Slovak state existed during World War II and  was a client state of Nazi Germany (from 1939 to 1944). In 1945  Czechoslovakia was reestablished.The present-day Slovakia became an  independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful dissolution of  Czechoslovakia.Slovakia is a high-income advanced economy with one of  the fastest growth rates in the European Union and the OECD.

Its capital and largest city is Ljubljana.Four major European  geographic units meet on the territory of Slovenia: the Alps, the  Dinaric Alps, the Pannonian Plain, and the Mediterranean, with a small  portion of coastline along the Adriatic Sea. The territory has a mosaic  structure and an exceptionally high landscape and biological diversity,  which are a result of natural attributes and the long-term presence of  humans. Although the climate in the mainly hilly territory is influenced  by the continental climate, the Slovene Littoral has the  sub-Mediterranean climate, while the Alpine climate is found in the  north-western part of the country.

Slovene is the only official language throughout the  country, whereas Italian and Hungarian are regional minority languages.  Slovenia is a largely secularized country, but its culture and identity  have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as  Lutheranism. The economy of Slovenia is small, open, and export-oriented  and has been strongly influenced by international conditions. It has  been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis, started in late 2000s. The  main economic field is services, followed by industry and  construction.Historically, the current territory of Slovenia was part of  many different state formations, including the Roman Empire and the  Holy Roman Empire, followed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In October  1918, the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by  co-founding the internationally unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats  and Serbs, which merged that December with the Kingdom of Serbia into  the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia  in 1929). During World War II, Slovenia was occupied and annexed by  Germany, Italy, Croatia, and Hungary. Afterward, it was a founding  member of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In June 1991, after the  introduction of multi-party representative democracy, Slovenia split  from Yugoslavia and became an independent country.

The name Korea  is derived from Goryeo, a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. It  shares land borders with North Korea to the north, and oversea borders  with China to the west and Japan to the east. South Korea lies in the  north temperate zone with a predominantly mountainous terrain. Roughly  half of the country's 50 million people reside in the metropolitan area  surrounding its capital, the Seoul Capital Area, which is the second  largest in the world with over 25 million residents.Archaeology  indicates that the Korean Peninsula was occupied by the Lower  Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the  founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC by the legendary Dangun. Following the  unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Silla AD 668, Korea was  ruled by the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) and Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910).  It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War  II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupation. An  election held in the U.S. zone in 1948 led to the creation of the  Republic of Korea. Although the United Nations passed a resolution  declaring the Republic to be the only lawful government in Korea, a  communist government was soon set up in the North that invaded the South  in 1950, leading to the Korean War that ended de facto in 1953.Between  1962 and 1994, the South Korean economy grew at an average of 10%  annually, fueled by annual export growth of 20%, in a period called the  Miracle on the Han River that rapidly transformed it into an affluent  G-20 major economy and the world's seventh largest country in  international trade. Civilian government replaced military rule in 1987  and the country has since become Asia's most advanced democracy as rated  by The Economist's Democracy Index. In 2009, South Korea became the  world's first former aid recipient to join the OECD's Development  Assistance Committee, graduating to a major donor. Today, it is Asia's  second largest donor, sending $1.74 billion of aid to the developing  world in 2013.South Korea is a developed country with the world's 12th  highest living standard, having a HDI of 0.909.

Sweden borders  Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel  across the Øresund. Sweden's capital city is Stockholm, which is also  the largest city. At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden  is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total  population of about 9.6 million. Sweden has a low population density of  21 inhabitants per square kilometre (54 /sq mi) with the population  mostly concentrated to the southern half of the country. About 85% of  the population live in urban areas.For centuries, Sweden was inhabited  by various Germanic tribes, who eventually became known as the Vikings.  Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle  Ages. In the 17th century, the country expanded its territories to form  the Swedish Empire. The empire grew to be one of the great powers of  Europe in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Most of the conquered  territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th  and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland,  was lost to Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly  involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a  personal union. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, remaining a  largely neutral nation.Today, Sweden is a constitutional monarchy with a  parliamentary democracy form of government and a highly developed  economy. Sweden has the world's eighth-highest per capita income and  ranks highly in numerous comparisons of national performance, including  quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties,  economic competitiveness, equality, prosperity and human development.

The country  is situated in Western and Central Europe, where it is bordered by Italy  to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and  Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country  geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura,  spanning an area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi). While the Alps occupy  the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately  8 million people is concentrated mostly on the Plateau, where the  largest cities are to be found. Among them are the two global cities and  economic centres of Zürich and Geneva.The establishment of the Swiss  Confederation is traditionally dated to 1 August 1291, which is  celebrated annually as Swiss National Day. It has a long history of  armed neutrality—it has not been in a state of war internationally since  1815—and did not join the United Nations until 2002. It pursues,  however, an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in  peace-building processes around the world. Switzerland is also the  birthplace of the Red Cross and home to a large number of international  organizations, including the second largest UN office. On the European  level, it is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association  and is part of the Schengen Area – although it is notably not a member  of the European Union, nor the European Economic Area. Switzerland  comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French,  Italian and the Romansh-speaking valleys. Therefore the Swiss, although  predominantly German-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a  common ethnic or linguistic identity; rather, the strong sense of  identity and community is founded on a common historical background,  shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine  symbolism.Switzerland has the highest nominal wealth per adult  (financial and non-financial assets) in the world according to Credit  Suisse and eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product on the IMF  list. Swiss citizens have the second-highest life expectancy in the  world on the UN DESA list. Switzerland is tied with the Netherlands for  the top rank on the Bribe Payers Index indicating very low levels of  business corruption. Moreover, for the last five years the country has  been ranked first in economic and tourist competitiveness according to  the Global Competitiveness Report and the Travel and Tourism  Competitiveness Report respectively, both developed by the World  Economic Forum.

Sunni Arabs make up the largest  population group in Syria.In English, the name ""Syria"" was formerly  synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as al-Sham) while the modern  state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires,  including the Eblan civilization of the third millennium BC. In the  Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a  provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.The modern Syrian  state was established after the first World War as a French mandate, and  represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly  Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence in April 1946, as a  parliamentary republic. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and  a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in  the period 1949–1971. Between 1958 and 1961, Syria entered a brief  union with Egypt, which was terminated by a military coup. Syria was  under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most  constitutional protections for citizens, and its system of government is  considered to be non-democratic.

Although the Spanish never  colonized the Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in  Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when  English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.The  Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718, when the British clamped  down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, thousands of  American Loyalists, taking their enslaved Africans, moved to the  Bahamas, where the Americans set up a plantation economy. After Britain  abolished the international slave trade in 1807, the Royal Navy  resettled many free Africans liberated from illegal slave ships in the  Bahamas during the 19th century. Hundreds of American slaves and Black  Seminoles escaped to the islands from Florida, and nearly 500 were freed  from American merchant ships in the domestic trade. Slavery in the  Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Today the descendants of slaves and free  Africans form the majority of the population; issues related to the  slavery years are part of society.

Turkey is bordered by eight  countries: Bulgaria to the northwest; Greece to the west; Georgia to the  northeast; Armenia, Iran and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to  the east; and Iraq and Syria to the southeast. The Mediterranean Sea is  to the south; the Aegean Sea is to the west; and the Black Sea is to the  north. The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which  together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between Thrace  and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location at  the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant  geostrategic importance.Turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic  age, including various Ancient Anatolian civilizations and Thracian  peoples. After Alexander the Great's conquest, the area was Hellenized,  which continued with the Roman rule and the transition into the  Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the  11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was greatly  accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of  Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the  Mongol invasion in 1243, upon which it disintegrated into several small  Turkish beyliks.Starting from the late 13th century, the Ottoman beylik  united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern  Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia  and Africa during the early modern period. After the Ottoman Empire  collapsed following its defeat in World War I, parts of it were occupied  by the victorious Allies. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues, resulted in the establishment  of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first  president.Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional  republic with a diverse cultural heritage. The country's official  language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by approximately  85% of the population. Turks constitute 70% to 75% of the population.  Minorities include Kurds (18%) and others (7–12%). The vast majority of  the population is Muslim. Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe,  NATO, OECD, OSCE and the G-20 major economies. Turkey began full  membership negotiations with the European Union in 2005, having been an  associate member of the European Economic Community since 1963 and  having joined the EU Customs Union in 1995.

Tuvalu's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers  an oceanic area of approximately 900,000 km2. Its nearest neighbours are  Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. Its population of 10,837 makes it the  third-least populous sovereign state in the world, with only the Vatican  City and Nauru having fewer inhabitants. In terms of physical land  size, at just 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) Tuvalu is the fourth  smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City at 0.44  km2 (0.17 sq mi), Monaco at 1.98 km2 (0.76 sq mi), and Nauru at 21 km2  (8.1 sq mi).The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians. In 1568  Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña sailed through the islands and is  understood to have sighted Nui during his expedition in search of Terra  Australis. In 1819 the island of Funafuti was named Ellice's Island; the  name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English  hydrographer Alexander George Findlay (1812–1876). The islands came  under Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each  of the Ellice Islands was declared a British protectorate by Captain  Gibson R.N., of HMS Curacoa, between 9 and 16 October 1892. The Ellice  Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident  Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific  Territories (BWPT), and later as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands  colony from 1916 to 1974.A referendum was held in December 1974 to  determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each  have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum, the  Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony ceased to exist on 1 January 1976 and  the separate British colonies of Kiribati and Tuvalu came into  existence.

It is one of the world's  most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of  large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate  of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide  variety of wildlife.Paleo-indians migrated from Asia to what is now the  U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization  beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British  colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great  Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4,  1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration  of Independence. The ensuing war ended in 1783 with the recognition of  independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and  was the first successful war of independence against a European  colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17,  1787. The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights,  were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and  freedoms.Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States  embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the  19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new  territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War  ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the  United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the  world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the  country's status as a global military power.

The  archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some 1,750 kilometres  (1,090 mi) east of northern Australia, 500 kilometres (310 mi) northeast  of New Caledonia, west of Fiji, and southeast of the Solomon Islands,  near New Guinea.Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. The  first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by  Portuguese navigator Fernandes de Queirós, who arrived in Espiritu Santo  in 1605; he claimed the archipelago for Spain and named it Espiritu  Santo (Spanish for Holy Spirit). In the 1880s France and the United  Kingdom claimed parts of the country, and in 1906 they agreed on a  framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides  through a British–French Condominium. An independence movement arose in  the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980.The nation's  name was derived from the word vanua (""land"" or ""home""), which occurs in  several Austronesian languages, and the word tu (""stand"").

Venezuela's territory covers around 916,445 square kilometres (353,841  sq mi) with an estimated population of approximately 29,100,000.  Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity, with  habitats ranging from the Andes mountains in the west to the Amazon  Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean  coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east.Venezuela  was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples.  In 1811 it became one of the first Spanish-American colonies to (declare  independence), which was not securely establish until 1821, when  Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of Gran Colombia. It  gained full independence as a separate country in 1830. During the 19th  century Venezuela suffered political turmoil and dictatorship, remaining  dominated by regional caudillos (military strongmen) until the mid-20th  century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic  governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several  political crises, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two  attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andrés  Pérez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in confidence  in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former career officer  Hugo Chávez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution, beginning with a  1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of  Venezuela.Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23  states, the Capital District (covering Caracas), and Federal  Dependencies (covering Venezuela's offshore islands). Venezuela also  claims all Guyanese territory west of the Essequibo River, a 159,500  square kilometres (61,583 sq mi) tract dubbed Guayana Esequiba or the  Zona en Reclamación (the ""zone being reclaimed"").Venezuela is among the  most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of  Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital,  Caracas, which is also the largest city in Venezuela. Since the  discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of  the world's leading exporters of oil and has the largest oil reserves.  Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such  as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government  revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a  long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996  and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell  to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.The recovery  of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated  social spending which significantly reduced inequality and poverty,  although the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis saw a renewed  economic downturn. By late 2010 Venezuela's economy had some growth,  though this has been sluggish and accompanied by high inflation and  shortages. In February 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to the  rising shortages in the country. Shortages of items included toilet  paper, milk, flour and other necessities. As of November 2013,  Venezuela's inflation has also greatly increased to 54%. According to  the 2013 Global Misery Index Scores, Venezuela was ranked as the top  spot globally with the highest misery index score.""@en"

With an estimated 90.3 million inhabitants as of 2012,  it is the world's 13th-most-populous country, and the  eighth-most-populous Asian country. The name Vietnam translates as  ""Southern Viet"" (synonymous with the much older term Nam Viet); it was  first officially adopted in 1802 by Emperor Gia Long, and was adopted  again in 1945 with the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam  under Ho Chi Minh. The country is bordered by China to the north, Laos  to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and the South China Sea to  the east. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of  North and South Vietnam in 1976.The Vietnamese became independent from  Imperial China in AD 938, following the resounding Vietnamese victory in  the Battle of Bạch Đằng River. Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties  flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into  Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the  French in the mid-19th century. Following a Japanese occupation in the  1940s, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War,  eventually expelling the French in 1954. Thereafter, Vietnam was divided  politically into two rival states, North and South Vietnam. Conflict  between the two sides intensified, with heavy intervention from the  United States, in what is known as the Vietnam War. The war ended with a  North Vietnamese victory in 1975.Vietnam was then unified under a  Communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated.  In 1986, the government initiated a series of economic and political  reforms which began Vietnam's path towards integration into the world  economy. By 2000, it had established diplomatic relations with most  nations. Since 2000, Vietnam's economic growth rate has been among the  highest in the world, and, in 2011, it had the highest Global Growth  Generators Index among 11 major economies. Its successful economic  reforms resulted in its joining the World Trade Organization in 2007.  However, regardless of the advancements that have been made in recent  years, the country still experiences high levels of income inequality,  disparities in access to healthcare, and a lack of gender equality.""@en"

Yemen is the  second largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km2 (203,850  sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is  bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf  of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east. Its capital  and largest city is Sana'a. Yemen's territory includes more than 200  islands. The largest of these is Socotra, which is about 354 km (220 mi)  to the south of mainland Yemen. Geographically, Yemen stretches from  the desert sands of the Rub' al Khali to mountain peaks 3,660 meters  above sea levels, and drops back down to the coast of the Red Sea and  the Gulf of Aden. The nation is separated from the Horn of Africa by the  strait of Bab-el-Mandeb.Yemen was home of the Sabaeans (biblical  Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and  probably also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275  AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish influenced  Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the 4th century AD whereas  Judaism and local Paganism was already established. Islam spread quickly  in 7th century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the  early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been  notoriously difficult. Several dynasties emerged from the 9th to 16th  century, the Rasulid being the strongest and most prosperous. The  country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early  20th century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established  after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of Yemen Arab  Republic in 1962. While South Yemen remained a British protectorate  until 1967. The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of  Yemen in 1990.Yemen is a developing country. Under the rule of President  Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described as a kleptocracy. According to  the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency  International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In 2011,  series of street protests began in 15 January against poverty,  unemployment and corruption as well as against Saleh's plan to amend  Yemen's constitution and eliminate presidential term limit, in effect  making him president for life. He was also planning to have his son  Ahmed Saleh succeed him.The United States considers AQAP to be the ""most  dangerous of all the franchises of Al-Qaeda"". The U.S sought a  controlled transition that would enable their counter-terrorism  operations to continue. Saleh handed over power to his vice Abd Rabbuh  Mansur Hadi and was granted immunity from prosecution. A National  Dialogue Conference was launched on 18 March 2012 to reach consensus on  major issues facing the country's future. The closing ceremony was held  on 25 January 2014. Yemen will become a multi-region federal republic.  President Hadi's term was extended for another year in order to appoint  and monitor two committees. One to choose between two federal regions  (North and South) or six; and the other one to draft a new constitution.  The committees are expected to finish their assignments by January  2015.""@en"
