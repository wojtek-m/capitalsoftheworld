It has a  population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately  652,000 km2 (252,000 sq mi), making it the 42nd most populous and 41st  largest nation in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and  the east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in  the north, and China in the far northeast.Afghanistan has been an  ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration. Archaeologists  have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the Middle  Paleolithic. Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as  3,000 to 2,000 BC. Sitting at an important geostrategic location that  connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the Indian  subcontinent, the land has been home to various peoples through the ages  and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by Alexander the Great,  Arab Muslims, Genghis Khan, and in modern-era Western forces. The land  also served as a source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids,  Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Mughals, Durranis and others have risen to form  major empires.The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan  begins in 1709 with the rise of the Pashtuns - historically known as  "Afghans" - when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed  by the rise of the Durrani Empire in 1747. In the late 19th century,  Afghanistan became a buffer state in the "Great Game" between British  India and the Russian Empire. Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War, King  Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was  stopped by ultra-conservatives. During the Cold War, after the  withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United  States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan,  which led in 1979 to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen  forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million  Afghans lost their lives. This was followed by a 1990s civil war, the  rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government, and the 2001–present  war. In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council authorized  the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to  help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai  administration.Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world''s  most dangerous countries. While the international community is  rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani  Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide  Taliban-led insurgency, which includes hundreds of assassinations and  suicide attacks. According to the United Nations, the insurgents were  responsible for 80% of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012.

The modern Republic became  independent after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in Europe following  the Balkan Wars. Albania declared independence in 1912 (to be  recognised in 1913), becoming a Principality, Republic, and Kingdom  until being invaded by Italy in 1939, which formed Greater Albania,  which in turn became a Nazi German protectorate in 1943.

The Kingdom of Armenia was established in the 6th century BC, after the  fall of Urartu; it became the first state in the world to adopt  Christianity as its official religion, in the early years of the 4th  century (the traditional date is 301 AD). For this reason, Armenia is  often referred to as the "first Christian nation." An Armenian  principality and later a kingdom, known as Cilician Armenia, existed on  the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th  centuries.By the 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland was  divided between the Ottoman and Russian empires. During World War I, the  Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were  systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. After almost 600  years of statelessness, Armenia was able to become independent in 1918;  however, the First Republic of Armenia was surrounded by hostile  countries that forcibly ended its independence in 1920. Between 1920 and  1991, Armenia was part of the Soviet Union.

It is bordered  by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north, Hungary and Slovakia to  the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and  Liechtenstein to the west. The territory of Austria covers 83,855 square  kilometres (32,377 sq mi) and has a temperate and alpine climate.  Austria''s terrain is highly mountainous due to the presence of the Alps;  only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640 ft), and its highest  point is 3,798 metres (12,461 ft). The majority of the population speak  local Bavarian dialects of German as their native language, and German  in its standard form is the country''s official language. Other local  official languages are Hungarian, Burgenland Croatian, and Slovene.The  origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg  dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy  Roman Empire. From the time of the Reformation, many Northern German  princes, resenting the authority of the Emperor, used Protestantism as a  flag of rebellion. The Thirty Years War, the influence of the Kingdom  of Sweden, and the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia, as well as the  Napoleonic invasions, all weakened the power of the Emperor in the North  of Germany, but in the South, and in non-German areas of the Empire,  the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control. During the 17th and 18th  centuries, Austria became one of the great powers of Europe and, in  response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French, the  Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804. Following Napoleon''s  defeat, Prussia emerged as Austria''s chief competitor for rule of a  larger Germany. Austria''s defeat by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz,  during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 cleared the way for Prussia to  assert control over the rest of Germany. In 1867, the empire was  reformed into Austria-Hungary. After the defeat of France in the 1870  Franco-Prussian War, Austria was left out of the formation of a new  German Empire, although in the following decades its politics, and its  foreign policy, increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led  Empire. During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of  Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the German Empire guided Austria in  issuing the ultimatum to Serbia that led to the declaration of the  First World War.After the collapse of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian)  Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I, Austria adopted and used the  name the Republic of German-Austria (Deutschösterreich, later  Österreich) in an attempt for union with Germany, but was forbidden due  to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The First Austrian  Republic was established in 1919. In the 1938 Anschluss, Austria was  occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany. This lasted until the end of World  War II in 1945, after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and  Austria''s former democratic constitution was restored. In 1955, the  Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state,  ending the occupation. In the same year, the Austrian Parliament created  the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian  Republic would become permanently neutral.Today, Austria is a  semi-presidential representative democracy comprising nine federal  states. The capital and largest city, with a population exceeding 1.7  million, is Vienna. Austria is one of the richest countries in the  world, with a nominal per capita GDP of $46,330 (2012 est.). The country  has developed a high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked 19th in  the world for its Human Development Index. Austria has been a member of  the United Nations since 1955, joined the European Union in 1995, and is  a founder of the OECD.

Its capital and largest city is Sarajevo. Bordered by Croatia to  the north, west and south, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro to the  southeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost landlocked, except for 20  kilometres (12 miles) of coastline on the Adriatic Sea surrounding the  city of Neum. In the central and eastern interior of the country the  geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and  the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically  larger region and has a moderate continental climate, bookended by hot  summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a  Mediterranean climate and plain topography.Bosnia and Herzegovina is a  region that traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age,  during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic  civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has  one of the richest histories in the region, having been first settled by  the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to  the 9th centuries CE. They then established the first independent  banate in the region, known as the Banate of Bosnia, in the early 12th  century upon the arrival and convergence of peoples that would  eventually come to call themselves Dobri Bošnjani ("Good Bosnians").  This evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century, after which  it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it would  remain from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The Ottomans  brought Islam to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social  outlook of the country. This was followed by annexation into the  Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which lasted up until World War I. In the  interwar period, Bosnia was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and  Slovenes and after World War II, the country was granted full republic  status in a newly formed Yugoslav Federation. Following the dissolution  of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the country proclaimed  independence in 1992, which was followed by the Bosnian War, lasting  until late 1995.Today, the country maintains high literacy, life  expectancy and education levels and is one of the most frequently  visited countries in the region, projected to have the third highest  tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020. Bosnia and  Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural  beauty and cultural heritage inherited from six historical  civilizations, its cuisine, winter sports, its eclectic and unique  music, architecture and its festivals, some of which are the largest and  most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is  home to three ethnic groups or, officially, constituent peoples, a term  unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosniaks are the largest group of the  three, with Serbs second and Croats third. Regardless of ethnicity, a  citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in English as a  Bosnian. The terms Herzegovinian and Bosnian are maintained as a  regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina  has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was  simply called "Bosnia" until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end  of the 19th century.Bosnia and Herzegovina has a bicameral legislature  and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic  group. However, the central government''s power is highly limited, as the  country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities:  the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, with a  third region, the Brčko District, governed under local government. The  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of  10 federal units - cantons. The country is a potential candidate for  membership to the European Union and has been a candidate for North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation membership since April 2010, when it  received a Membership Action Plan at a summit in Tallinn.

Bangladesh is the eighth-most  populous nation in the world, with a population of over 160 million  people, and is also among the world''s most densely populated countries.  It forms part of the ancient and historic ethno-linguistic region of  Bengal, together with the neighbouring Indian states of West Bengal and  Tripura. The borders of modern Bangladesh took shape during the  Partition of Bengal and British India in 1947, when the region became  the eastern wing of the newly formed state of Pakistan. Following years  of political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination, and  economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, a surge of  popular agitation, nationalism and civil disobedience led in 1971 to the  Bangladesh Liberation War, resulting in the separation of the region  from Pakistan and the formation of an independent Bangladesh. After  independence, the new state proclaimed a secular multiparty democracy.  The country then endured decades of poverty, famine, political turmoil  and military coups. Since the restoration of democracy in 1991, the  country has experienced relative calm and economic progress, though its  main political parties remain polarized.Bangladesh is a unitary secular  parliamentary republic, with an elected parliament called the Jatiyo  Sangshad. It has seven administrative divisions and 64 districts. The  Bengalis the country''s largest ethnic group, whereas the indigenous  peoples in northern and southeastern districts form a significant and  diverse ethnic minority. Geographically, the country is dominated by the  fertile Bengal delta, the largest delta in the world. It has been  described as the "land of rivers". Bangladesh is identified as a Next  Eleven economy. According to the United Nations in 2010, the country is  making major strides in human development, including significant  progress in the areas of gender equity, universal primary education, the  empowerment of women, reducing population growth, food production,  health and renewable energy. The poverty rate has declined considerably  since independence, and per-capita income has doubled from 1975 levels.  Major cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong have been the driving forces  behind much of the recent growth. However, the country continues to face  a number of major political and social challenges, including endemic  bureaucratic and political corruption, widespread poverty, political  instability, overpopulation and vulnerability to global climate  change.Bangladesh is a pioneer and founding member of SAARC.

The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the  establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 CE, which dominated  most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during  the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in  1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries.  The Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) led to the formation of the Third  Bulgarian State. The following years saw several conflicts with its  neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world  wars.

After the American War of Independence, thousands of American Loyalists, taking their enslaved Africans, moved to the Bahamas, where the Americans set up a plantation economy. After Britain abolished the international slave trade in 1807, the Royal Navy resettled many free Africans liberated from illegal slave ships in the Bahamas during the 19th century. Hundreds of American slaves and Black Seminoles escaped to the islands from Florida, and nearly 500 were freed from American merchant ships in the domestic trade. Slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Today the descendants of slaves and free Africans form the majority of the population; issues related to the slavery years are part of society.

In 1945, Belarus became a founding member of the United  Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.The  parliament of the republic declared the sovereignty of Belarus on 27  July 1990, and during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus  declared independence on 25 August 1991. Alexander Lukashenko has been  the country''s president since 1994. Lukashenko continued a number of  Soviet-era policies, such as state ownership of large sections of the  economy. According to some organizations and countries opposed to  Alexander Lukashenko, elections have been unfair, and political  opponents have been violently suppressed. In 2000, Belarus and Russia  signed a treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a  Union State. Belarus'' Democracy Index rating continuously ranks the  lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as "Not Free" by Freedom  House, "Repressed" in the Index of Economic Freedom, and is rated as by  far the worst country for press freedom in Europe in the 2013-14 Press  Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, where Belarus is  ranked 157th out of an overall total of 180 nations. For these reasons,  the country is referred to as the ''Last Dictatorship in Europe'' by ''The  Guardian''.Over 70% of Belarus''s population of 9.49 million resides in  urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic Belarusian, with  sizable minorities of Russians, Poles and Ukrainians. Since a referendum  in 1995, the country has had two official languages: Belarusian and  Russian. The Constitution of Belarus does not declare any official  religion, although the primary religion in the country is Eastern  Orthodox Christianity. The second most popular, Roman Catholicism, has a  much smaller following, although both Orthodox and Catholic versions of  Christmas and Easter are celebrated as national holidays."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belarus', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus', '', '', 15633, '', '50', 2013, 'Belarus (/bɛləˈruːs/ bel-ə-ROOSS; Belarusian: Белару́сь Bielaruś pronounced [bʲɛlaˈrusʲ]; Russian: Белару́сь, Респу́блика Беларусь Belarus’, Respublika Belarus’), officially the Republic of Belarus, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest.

Beginning in the  late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the  region''s Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the  United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left in  the late 18th century with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant  to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined  to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an  accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing  dominion. In 1931 Britain granted Canada full independence in most  matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931.

It has the second-highest total Christian population in Africa.The Second Congo War, beginning in 1998, devastated the country and is sometimes referred to as the "African world war" because it involved nine African nations and twenty armed groups. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continued in the east of the country in 2007.

It is bordered by Chad in the north, Sudan in the northeast, South Sudan in the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo in the south and Cameroon in the west. The CAR covers a land area of about 620,000 square kilometres (240,000 sq mi) and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008. The capital is Bangui.France called the colony it carved out in this region Oubangui-Chari, as most of the territory was located in the Ubangi and Chari river basins. From 1910 until 1960, the colony was part of French Equatorial Africa. It became a semi-autonomous territory of the French Community in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August 1960, taking its present name. For over three decades after independence, the CAR was ruled by presidents or an emperor, who either were unelected or seized power. Local discontent with this system was eventually reinforced by international pressure, following the end of the Cold War.The first multi-party democratic elections in the CAR were held in 1993, with the aid of resources provided by the country''s donors and help from the United Nations. The elections brought Ange-Félix Patassé to power, but he lost popular support during his presidency and was overthrown in 2003 by General François Bozizé, who went on to win a democratic election in May 2005. Bozizé''s inability to pay public sector workers led to strikes in 2007, which led him to appoint a new government on 22 January 2008, headed by Faustin-Archange Touadéra. In February 2010, Bozizé signed a presidential decree which set 25 April 2010 as the date for the next presidential election. This was postponed, but elections were held in January and March 2011, which were won by Bozizé and his party. Despite maintaining a veneer of stability, Bozizé''s rule was plagued by heavy corruption, underdevelopment, nepotism, and authoritarianism, which led to an open rebellion against his government. The rebellion was led by an alliance of armed opposition factions known as the Séléka Coalition during the Central African Republic Bush War (2004–2007) and the 2012–2013 Central African Republic conflict. This eventually led to his deposition on 24 March 2013. As a result of the coup d''etat and resulting chaos, governance in the CAR has dissolved and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye has said the country is "anarchy, a non-state." Both the president and prime minister resigned in January, 2014, to be replaced by an interim leader.Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas, but the country also includes a Sahelo-Sudanian zone in the north and an equatorial forest zone in the south. Two-thirds of the country lie in the basins of the Ubangi River, which flows south into the Congo, while the remaining third lies in the basin of the Chari, which flows north into Lake Chad.Despite its significant mineral deposits and other resources, such as uranium reserves in Bakouma, crude oil in Vakaga, gold, diamonds, lumber, and hydropower, as well as significant quantities of arable land, the Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world and is among the ten poorest countries in Africa.

Among them are the two global cities and  economic centres of Zürich and Geneva.The establishment of the Swiss  Confederation is traditionally dated to 1 August 1291, which is  celebrated annually as Swiss National Day. It has a long history of  armed neutrality—it has not been in a state of war internationally since  1815—and did not join the United Nations until 2002. It pursues,  however, an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in  peace-building processes around the world.

Prior to its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoulé. There were two Anyi kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi, which attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and after independence. An 1843–1844 treaty made Ivory Coast a protectorate of France and in 1893, it became a French colony as part of the European scramble for Africa. Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August 1960. From 1960 to 1993, the country was led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny. It maintained close political and economic association with its West African neighbours, while at the same time maintaining close ties to the West, especially to France. Since the end of Houphouët-Boigny''s rule, Ivory Coast has experienced one coup d’état, in 1999, and a civil war, which broke out in 2002. A political agreement between the government and the rebels brought a return to peace.Ivory Coast is a republic with a strong executive power invested in the President of Ivory Coast. Its de jure capital is Yamoussoukro and the biggest city is the port city of Abidjan. The country is divided into 19 regions and 81 departments. It is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, African Union, La Francophonie, Latin Union, Economic Community of West African States and South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone. Through production of coffee and cocoa, the country was an economic powerhouse during the 1960s and 1970s in West Africa. However, Ivory Coast went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, leading to the country''s period of political and social turmoil. The 21st century Ivoirian economy is largely market-based and relies heavily on agriculture, with smallholder cash crop production being dominant.The official language is French, although many of the local languages are widely used, including Baoulé, Dioula, Dan, Anyin and Cebaara Senufo.

Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a  string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of  fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.Spain conquered  and settled Chile in the mid-16th century effectively replacing Inca  rule in northern and central Chile but failed to conquer the independent  Mapuche that inhabited south-central Chile. After declaring its  independence from Spain in 1818, Chile emerged in the 1830s as a  relatively stable authoritarian republic. In the 19th century, Chile  experienced significant economic and territorial growth ending Mapuche  resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in  the War of the Pacific (1879–83) after defeating Peru and Bolivia. In  the late 1960s and early 1970s, the country experienced severe  left-right political polarization and turmoil. This development  culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d''état that overthrew Salvador  Allende''s left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing  military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing.

Cameroon''s coastline lies on the  Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. The  country is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" for its geological  and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts,  mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is Mount  Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaoundé  and Garoua. Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups.  The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly  makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.  French and English are the official languages.Early inhabitants of the  territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka  hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers  reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos  Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani  soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century,  and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful  chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as  ''Kamerun".After World War I, the territory was divided between France  and Britain as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du  Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed  by France in the 1950s. It waged war on French and UPC militant forces  until 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became  independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo.  The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form  the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country was renamed the United  Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in  1984.Compared with other African countries, Cameroon enjoys relatively  high political and social stability. This has permitted the development  of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber  industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty  as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the  authoritarian president since 1982, Paul Biya, and his Cameroon People''s  Democratic Movement party.

It exercises jurisdiction  over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled  municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two  mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and  Macau). The PRC also claims Taiwan – which is controlled by the Republic  of China (ROC), a separate political entity – as its 23rd province, a  claim which is controversial due to the complex political status of  Taiwan.Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometers, China is  the world''s second-largest country by land area, and either the third or  fourth-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement.  China''s landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from forest steppes and  the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests  in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan  mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The Yangtze  and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from  the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China''s  coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi) long,  and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East and South China Seas.The  history of China goes back to the ancient civilization – one of the  world''s earliest – that flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow  River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China''s political system  was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with  the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since  221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a  Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed  numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty  in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of  the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the  nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People''s  Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang  relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei.Since the  introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the  world''s fastest-growing major economies. As of 2013, it is the world''s  second-largest economy by both nominal total GDP and purchasing power  parity (PPP), and is also the world''s largest exporter and importer of  goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world''s  largest standing army, with the second-largest defense budget. The PRC  has been a United Nations member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as  a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. China is also a member  of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including  the WTO, APEC, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the BCIM  and the G-20.

It is a unitary,  constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments.The territory  of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples  including the Muisca, Quimbaya, and Tairona. The Spanish arrived in 1499  and initiated a period of conquest and colonization ultimately creating  the Viceroyalty of New Granada, with its capital at Bogotá.  Independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 "Gran Colombia" had  collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador. What is now  Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic of New Granada. The new  nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation  (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the  Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. Panama seceded in  1903.Since the 1960s, the country has suffered from an asymmetric  low-intensity armed conflict.

This has also been influenced by  Colombia''s varied geography, and the imposing landscape of the country  has resulted in the development of very strong regional identities.

Cuba remained a colony of Spain  until the Spanish–American War of 1898, after which it was briefly  administered by the United States until gaining nominal independence in  1902. The fragile republic endured increasingly radical politics and  social strife, and despite efforts to strengthen its democratic system,  Cuba came under the dictatorship of former president Fulgencio Batista  in 1952. Growing unrest and instability led to Batista''s ousting in  January 1959 by the July 26 movement, which afterwards established a new  socialist administration under the leadership of Fidel Castro.

Located 570 kilometres (350 miles) off the coast of  Western Africa, the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4,000  square kilometres (1,500 sq mi). Three (Sal, Boa Vista and Maio) are  fairly flat, sandy and dry; the others generally rockier with more  vegetation.Historically, the name "Cape Verde" has been used in English  for the archipelago and, since independence, for the country. In 2013,  the Cape Verdean government determined that the Portuguese designation  "Cabo Verde" would henceforth be used for official purposes, such as at  the United Nations, even in English contexts. Portuguese explorers  discovered and colonized the previously uninhabited islands in the 15th  century. Ideally located for the Atlantic slave trade, they grew  prosperous and often attracted privateers and pirates, among them Sir  Francis Drake, a corsair privateering under Letter of marque granted by  the English crown who twice sacked the (then) capital Ribeira Grande in  the 1580s. The islands were also visited by Charles Darwin''s expedition  in 1832.Decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an  economic crisis. With few natural resources and inadequate sustainable  investment from the Portuguese, the citizens grew increasingly  discontented with the colonial masters, who nevertheless refused to  provide the local authorities with more autonomy. A budding independence  movement (originally led by Amílcar Cabral, assassinated on 20 January  1973) passed on to his half-brother Luís Cabral and culminated in  independence for the archipelago in 1975.Cape Verde''s population is  mostly creole; its capital city Praia accounts for a quarter of the  country''s estimated 500,000 citizens. Over 65% of the population in the  archipelago lives in urban centers, and the literacy rate is around 87%  (i.e., 91% among men aged 15 above and 83% among women aged 15 above)  according to the 2013 Cape Verdean census. Politically, the country is a  very stable democracy. Its notable economic growth and improvement in  living conditions despite a lack of natural resources has garnered  international recognition, with other countries and international  organizations often providing development aid. Since 2007, Cape Verde  has been classified as a developing nation.Tough economic times during  the last decades of its colonization and the first years of independence  led many Cape Verdeans to emigrate to Europe, the Americas and other  African countries. Today these émigrés and their descendants outnumber  the domestic population. Historically, remittances from these émigrés to  their extended families in Cape Verde has provided a substantial  contribution to the country''s economy. However, later generations are  less likely to send money back and currently, the Cape Verdean economy  is mostly service-oriented with a growing focus on tourism and foreign  investment, which benefits from the islands'' warm year-round climate,  diverse landscape and cultural wealth, especially in music."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_Verde', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_language', 4483, '', '132', 2013, 'Cape Verde /ˌkeɪp ˈvɜrd/ (Portuguese: Cabo Verde, pronounced: [ˈkabu ˈveɾdɨ]), officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central Atlantic Ocean.

Cyprus is the third largest and third most  populous island in the Mediterranean, and a member state of the European  Union. It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon,  northwest of Israel, north of Egypt and east of Greece.The earliest  known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium  BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved  Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the  oldest water wells in the world. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks  in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. At a strategic location in the  Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers,  including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from  whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent  rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Roman Empire, the Byzantines, Arab  caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the  Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman control.  Cyprus was placed under British administration in 1878 until it was  granted independence in 1960, becoming a member of the Commonwealth the  following year. In 1974, seven years after the intercommunal violence  between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, an attempted coup d''état by  Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta  with the aim of achieving enosis (union of the island with Greece) took  place. Turkey used this as a pretext to invade the northern portion of  the island. Turkish forces remained after a cease-fire, resulting in the  partition of the island; an objective of Turkey since 1955. The  intercommunal violence and subsequent Turkish invasion led to the  displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots,  and the establishment of a separate Turkish Cypriot political entity in  the north. These events and the resulting political situation are  matters of a continuing dispute.The Republic of Cyprus has de jure  sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters,  according to international law, except for the British Overseas  Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base  Areas. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two  main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic,  comprising about 59% of the island''s area, and the Turkish-controlled  area in the north, calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus and recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island''s  area. The international community considers the northern part of the  island as territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish  forces.Cyprus is a major tourist destination in the Mediterranean. An  advanced, high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index,  the Republic of Cyprus was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  until it joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.

The country is bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the  south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the north. Prague is the  capital and largest city, with 1.3 million residents. The Czech Republic  includes the historical territories of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as a  small part of Silesia.The Czech state, formerly known as Bohemia  (Čechy), was formed in the late 9th century as a small duchy around  Prague, at that time under the dominance of the powerful Great Moravian  Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power was  transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslids. In 1002,  Bohemia was formally recognized as a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire,  rising to the status of kingdom in 1212. During the rule of the  Přemyslids and their successors, the Luxembourgs, Bohemia expanded in  size until reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century.  During the Hussite wars, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and  crusades from all over Europe. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526,  the Kingdom of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg  monarchy as one of its three principal parts, alongside the Archduchy of  Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Bohemian Revolt (1618–20)  against Habsburg rule led to the Thirty Years'' War, after which the  monarchy consolidated its rule, re-imposed Catholicism, and enforced a  policy of Germanization. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire  in 1806, the Bohemian kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire. In the  19th century the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the  monarchy and the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was  formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire  after World War I. After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only  democracy in central and eastern Europe.Following the Munich Agreement  and the Polish annexation of Zaolzie, Czechoslovakia fell under German  occupation during World War II. By 1945, a major portion of the country  was liberated by the Red Army, and the subsequent gratitude towards the  Soviets, combined with disillusionment with the West for failing to  intervene, led the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to victory in the  1946 elections. Following the 1948 coup d''état, Czechoslovakia became a  single-party communist state under Soviet influence. In 1968, increasing  dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known  as the Prague Spring, which ended with an invasion by the armies of the  Warsaw Pact countries (with the exception of Romania). Czechoslovakia  remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist  regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed. On 1  January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent  states: the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.In 2006, the Czech  Republic became first former member of the Comecon to achieve the status  of a developed country, according to the World Bank. The country has  the highest level of human development in Central and Eastern Europe,  ranking among the top 30 nations in the world. The Czech Republic ranks  as the ninth-most peaceful country in Europe, while achieving the best  performance in democratic governance and infant mortality in the region.

Germany is the major economic and  political power of the European continent and a historic leader in many  cultural, theoretical and technical fields.Various Germanic tribes  occupied what is now northern Germany and southern Scandinavia since  classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented by the  Romans before AD 100. During the Migration Period that coincided with  the decline of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes expanded southward  and established kingdoms throughout much of Europe. Beginning in the  10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman  Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the  centre of the Protestant Reformation. Occupied during the Napoleonic  Wars, the rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted  in the unification of most of the German states in 1871 into the German  Empire, which was dominated by Prussia.After the German Revolution of  1918–1919 and the subsequent military surrender in World War I, the  Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic in 1918, with  some of its territory partitioned in the Treaty of Versailles. Despite  its lead in many scientific and cultural fields at this time, Germany  nonetheless endured significant economic and political instability,  which intensified during the Great Depression and contributed to the  establishment of the Third Reich in 1933. The subsequent rise of fascism  led to World War II. After 1945, Germany was divided by allied  occupation, and evolved into two states, East Germany and West Germany.  In 1990, the country was reunified.Germany has the world''s  fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by  purchasing power parity. As a global leader in several industrial and  technological sectors, it is the second-largest exporter and  third-largest importer of goods.

Nearby Zeila (now in Somalia) was the seat of the  medieval Adal and Ifat Sultanates. In the late 19th century, the colony  of French Somaliland was established following treaties signed by the  ruling Somali and Afar sultans with the French and its railroad to Dire  Dawa (and later Addis Ababa) allowed it to quickly supersede Zeila as  the port for southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden. It was subsequently  renamed to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas in 1967. A  decade later, the Djiboutian people voted for independence. This  officially marked the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti, named  after its capital city. Djibouti joined the United Nations the same  year, on September 20, 1977. In the early 1990s, tensions over  government representation led to armed conflict, which ended in a power  sharing agreement in 2000 between the ruling party and the  opposition.Djibouti is a multi-ethnic nation with a population of over  810,000 inhabitants. The Somali and Afar make up the two largest ethnic  groups. Both speak Afro-Asiatic languages, which serve as recognized  national languages. Arabic and French constitute the country''s two  official languages.

The Kingdom includes two autonomous constituent  countries in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.  At 43,094 square kilometres (16,638.69 sq mi), with a population of  around 5.6 million inhabitants, Denmark consists of a peninsula,  Jutland, and the Danish archipelago of 407 islands, of which around 70  are inhabited. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and  sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. The national  language, Danish, is closely related to and mutually intelligible with  Swedish and Norwegian.The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary constitutional  monarchy, with Margrethe II as queen regnant, organised as a  parliamentary democracy. The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5  June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. The  Constitution has been revised four times, most recently in 1953. The  seat of government is in the capital of Copenhagen. Denmark exercises  hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving political powers to  handle internal affairs. Denmark became a member of the European Union  in 1973, maintaining four opt-outs from European Union policies, as  outlined in the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement. Both the Faroe Islands and  Greenland remain outside the Union.The unified kingdom of Denmark  emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the  struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark was part of the Kalmar  Union, established in 1397, ended with Swedish secession in 1523. The  following year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway, which lasted  nearly three centuries until its dissolution in 1814. Beginning in the  17th century, there were several cessions of Danish territory; these  culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements, which  were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral  during World War I. In April 1940, Denmark was invaded by Germany with  brief, military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was  active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. Denmark joined  NATO in 1949, relinquishing its historically neutral stance. An  industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of  the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in  the early decades of the 20th century, making the basis for the present  welfare state with a highly developed mixed market economy. The Danish  krone has been pegged to the euro since 1 January 1999.Denmark is  frequently ranked as the happiest country in the world in cross-national  studies of happiness. Denmark ranks as having the world''s highest  social mobility, a high level of income equality, has one of the world''s  highest per capita income, and has one of the world''s highest personal  income tax rates. For 2013, Denmark is listed 15th on the Human  Development Index and 9th on the inequality-adjusted HDI. Denmark ranks  highly positive on the Corruption Perceptions Index and the Legatum  Prosperity Index, and as a full democracy on the Democracy Index.  Denmark is among the founding members of the NATO, the Nordic Council,  OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations.

In the hundred years after Columbus''s landing, Dominica  remained isolated. More Caribs settled there after being driven from  surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region. France had a  colony for several years, importing African slaves to work on its  plantations. In this period, the Antillean Creole language developed.  France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763.  Great Britain established a small colony on the island in 1805.Britain  emancipated slaves throughout the British Empire in 1834. By 1838,  Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a legislature  controlled by an ethnic African majority. In 1896, the United Kingdom  took governmental control of Dominica, turning it into a Crown colony.  Half a century later, from 1958 to 1962, Dominica became a province of  the short-lived West Indies Federation. On 3 November 1978, Dominica  became an independent nation."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dominica', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language', 14166, '', '', 2013, 'Dominica (/ˌdɒmɪˈniːkə/ DOM-i-NEE-kə; French: Dominique; Kali‘na (Carib): Wai‘tu kubuli),[citation needed] officially the Commonwealth of Dominica, is an island nation in the Lesser Antilles region of the Caribbean Sea, south-southeast of Guadeloupe and northwest of Martinique.

Both by area  and population, the Dominican Republic is the second largest Caribbean  nation (after Cuba), with 48,445 square kilometres (18,705 sq mi) and an  estimated 10 million people, one million of which live in the capital  city, Santo Domingo.Taínos inhabited what is now the Dominican Republic  since the 7th century. Christopher Columbus landed on the island in  1492, and it became the site of the first permanent European settlement  in the Americas, namely Santo Domingo, the country''s capital and Spain''s  first capital in the New World. After three centuries of Spanish rule,  with French and Haitian interludes, the country became independent in  1821. The ruler, José Núñez de Cáceres, intended that the Dominican  Republic be part of the nation of Gran Colombia, but he was quickly  removed by the Haitian government and "Dominican" slave revolts.  Victorious in the Dominican War of Independence in 1844, Dominicans  experienced mostly internal strife over the next 72 years, and also a  brief return to Spanish rule. The United States occupation of 1916–1924,  and a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio  Vásquez Lajara, were followed by the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas  Trujillo Molina until 1961. The civil war of 1965, the country''s last,  was ended by a U.S.-led intervention, and was followed by the  authoritarian rule of Joaquín Balaguer, 1966–1978. Since then, the  Dominican Republic has moved toward representative democracy, and has  been led by Leonel Fernández for most of the time after 1996. Danilo  Medina, the Dominican Republic''s current president, succeeded Fernández  in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent  ex-president Hipólito Mejía.The Dominican Republic has the ninth largest  economy in Latin America and the second largest economy in the  Caribbean and Central American region. Though long known for agriculture  and mining, the economy is now dominated by services. The country''s  economic progress is exemplified by its advanced telecommunication  system, and transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, unemployment,  government corruption, and inconsistent electric service remain major  Dominican problems. The country also has "marked income inequality".  International migration affects the Dominican Republic greatly, as it  receives and sends large flows of migrants. Haitian immigration and the  integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues. A large  Dominican diaspora exists, mostly in the United States. They contribute  to national development as they send billions of dollars to their  families.The Dominican Republic is the most visited destination in the  Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are among the top attractions on  the island. As one of the region''s most geographically diverse  countries, the Dominican Republic boasts the Caribbean''s highest  mountain peak, Pico Duarte, as well as the Caribbean''s largest lake and  lowest elevation, Lake Enriquillo. The island has an average temperature  of 26 °C (78.8 °F) and great biological diversity. The country is also  home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of  the Americas, located in Santo Domingo''s Colonial Zone, an area declared  as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

It is the most populous territory on that list, and by far the largest in area. In 1965, the UN General Assembly adopted its first resolution on Western Sahara, asking Spain to decolonise the territory. One year later, a new resolution was passed by the General Assembly requesting that a referendum be held by Spain on self-determination.In 1975, Spain relinquished the administrative control of the territory to a joint administration by Morocco (which had formally claimed the territory since 1957) and Mauritania. A war erupted between those countries and the Sahrawi national liberation movement, the Polisario Front, which proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) with a government-in-exile in Tindouf, Algeria. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, and Morocco eventually secured effective control of most of the territory, including all the major cities and natural resources.Since a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire agreement in 1991, two thirds of the territory (including most of the Atlantic coast line) has been controlled by Morocco and the remainder by the SADR, strongly backed by Algeria. Internationally, countries such as the United States and Russia have taken a generally ambiguous and neutral position on each side''s claims, and have pressed both parties to agree on a peaceful resolution. Both Morocco and Polisario have sought to boost their claims by accumulating formal recognition, essentially from African, Asian, and Latin American states in the developing world. The Polisario Front has won formal recognition for SADR from 82 states, and was extended membership in the African Union. Morocco has won recognition or support for its position from several African governments and from most of the Arab League.

It is bordered by Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti  and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to  the south. With over 93,000,000 inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most  populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most  populated nation on the African continent. It occupies a total area of  1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest  city is Addis Ababa.Some of the oldest evidence for modern humans is  found in Ethiopia, which is widely considered the region from which Homo  sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. Tracing  its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of  its history. Alongside Rome, Persia, China and India, the Kingdom of  Aksum was one of the great world powers of the 3rd century. In the 4th  century, it was the first major empire in the world to officially adopt  Christianity as a state religion.Ethiopia derived prestige for its  uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century  Scramble for Africa, and subsequently many African nations adopted the  colors of Ethiopia''s flag following their independence. Ethiopia was the  only African country to defeat a European colonial power and retain its  sovereignty as an independent country. It was the first independent  African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the UN. In  1974, at the end of Haile Selassie I''s reign, power fell to a communist  military junta known as the Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it  was defeated by the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the  collapse of the USSR in 1991.Ethiopia is a multilingual society with  around 80 ethnic groups, with the two largest being the Oromo and the  Amhara. It is the origin of the coffee bean. Ethiopia is a land of  natural contrasts; with its vast fertile West, jungles, and numerous  rivers, the World''s hottest settlement in its north, Africa''s largest  continuous mountain ranges and the largest cave in Africa at Sof Omar.  Ethiopia has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Ethiopia''s  ancient Ge''ez script, also known as Ethiopic, is one of the oldest  alphabets still in use in the world. The Ethiopian calendar, which is  seven years and about three months behind the Gregorian calendar,  co-exists alongside the Oromo calendar. The majority of the population  is Christian and a third is Muslim; the country is the site of the first  Hijra in Islamic history and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa at  Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta  Israel, resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s but most of them have since  gradually emigrated to Israel. Ethiopia is also the spiritual homeland  of the Rastafari movement, which globalized its flag colors worldwide  via pop culture and Reggae music.Ethiopia is one of the founding members  of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, G-77 and  the Organisation of African Unity, with Addis Ababa serving as the  headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce  and Industry, the UNECA, the African Standby Force and much of global  NGOs focused on Africa. Despite being the main source of the Nile, the  longest river on earth, Ethiopia underwent a series of famines in the  1980s, exacerbated by civil wars and adverse geopolitics.

In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in  Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in  the capital of Helsinki, local governments in 336 municipalities and an  autonomous region, the Åland Islands. About one million residents live  in the Greater Helsinki area (consisting of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and  Kauniainen), which also produces a third of the country''s GDP. Other  large cities include Tampere, Turku, Oulu, Jyväskylä, Lahti, and  Kuopio.From the 12th until the early 19th century, Finland was part of  Sweden, a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and  its official status. It then became an autonomous Grand Duchy within  the Russian Empire until the Russian Revolution, which prompted the  Finnish Declaration of Independence. This was followed by a civil war  where the pro-Bolshevik "Reds" were defeated by the pro-conservative  "Whites" with support from the German Empire. After a brief attempt to  establish a monarchy, Finland became a republic. Finland''s experience of  World War II involved three separate conflicts: the Winter War  (1939–1940) and Continuation War (1941–1944) against the Soviet Union  and the Lapland War (1944–1945) against Nazi Germany. Following the end  of the war, Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an  official policy of neutrality. Nevertheless, it remained fairly active  on the world stage, joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD) in 1969, the European Union in 1995, and the  eurozone at its inception in 1999.Finland was a relative latecomer to  industrialisation, remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s.  Thereafter, it rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an  extensive Nordic-style welfare state, resulting in widespread prosperity  and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. Subsequently,  Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance,  including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality  of life, and human development.

The  farthest island is Onu-i-Lau. The two major islands, Viti Levu and Vanua  Levu, account for 87% of the population of almost 860,000. The capital  and largest city, Suva, is on Viti Levu. About three-quarters of Fijians  live on Viti Levu''s coasts, either in Suva or in smaller urban centres  like Nadi (tourism) or Lautoka (sugar cane industry).

The archipelago, with an area of 4,700 square miles (12,200 km²), comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory the Falklands enjoy internal self-governance, with the United Kingdom taking responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands'' capital is Stanley, on East Falkland.Controversy exists over the Falklands'' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, although Argentina maintained its claim to the islands. In 1982, after Argentina''s invasion of the islands, the two-month undeclared Falklands War resulted in the surrender of Argentine forces and the return of the islands to British administration.The population (an estimated 2,932 in 2012) primarily consists of native Falkland Islanders, the majority of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, Gibraltarian and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, Saint Helena and Chile has reversed a population decline.

The cultural and technological achievements of Greece greatly  influenced the world, with many aspects of Greek civilization being  imparted to the East through Alexander the Great''s campaigns, and to the  West through its incorporation into the Roman Empire. This rich legacy  is partly reflected by the 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in  Greece, ranking it 6th in Europe and 13th in the world.

The head of the government, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, is chosen by an Election Committee of 400 to 1,200 members, a situation that will be in effect during the first 20 years of Chinese rule.Hong Kong is a world city. It is one of the Al­pha+ cities. Also, a Time Magazine article in 2008 coined the phrase "Nylonkong", which referred to New York City, London and Hong Kong, that these three cities form a global network that facilitates the global economy. As Hong Kong ranks the third most important leading international financial centre, after London and New York City, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the currency, Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. The lack of space caused demand for denser constructions, which developed the city to a centre for modern architecture and the world''s most vertical city. Hong Kong has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. The dense space also led to a highly developed transportation network with the public transport travelling rate exceeding 90 percent, the highest in the world. Hong Kong has numerous high international rankings in various aspects. For instance, its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption perception, Human Development Index are all ranked highly. According to estimates from both UN and WHO, Hong Kong had the longest life expectancy of any region in the world in 2012. Hong Kong also has the highest average IQ score among 81 countries around the world.', 'http://dbpedia.org/page/Hong_Kong', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong', 'Hong Kong dollar ', 'Chinese, English', 52984, '10', '15', 2014, 'Hong Kong (香港, see Name section), alternatively known by its initials H.K., is a Special Administrative Region of the People''s Republic of China situated on China''s south coast and enclosed by the Pearl River Delta and South China Sea.

The country''s population is  4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious  denomination being Roman Catholicism. The Croats arrived in the area of  present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They  organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became  the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom.  The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two  centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Krešimir IV  and Dmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in  1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament  elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In  1918, after World War I, Croatia was included in the unrecognised State  of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs which seceded from Austria–Hungary and  merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A fascist Croatian puppet state  existed during World War II. After the war, Croatia became a founding  member and a federal constituent of Second Yugoslavia, a socialist  state. In June 1991, Croatia declared independence, which came into  effect on 8 October of the same year. The Croatian War of Independence  was fought successfully during the four years following the  declaration.Croatia today has a very high Human Development Index. The  International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and  developing economy, and the World Bank identified it as a high income  economy. Croatia is a member of the European Union, United Nations, the  Council of Europe, NATO, the World Trade Organization and a founding  member of the Union for the Mediterranean. As an active participant in  the UN peacekeeping forces, Croatia has contributed troops to the  NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN  Security Council for the 2008–2009 term.The service sector dominates  Croatia''s economy, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture.  Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with  Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world.  The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government  expenditure. The European Union is Croatia''s most important trading  partner. Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in  infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the  Pan-European corridors.

French and Haitian Creole are the  official languages.Haiti''s regional, historical, and ethno-linguistic  position is unique for several reasons. When it gained independence in  1804, it was the first independent nation of Latin America and the  Caribbean, the only nation in the world established as a result of a  successful slave revolt, and the second republic in the Americas. Its  successful revolution by slaves and free people of color lasted nearly a  decade; all the first leaders of government were former slaves. Haiti  is the only predominantly Francophone independent nation in the  Americas. It is one of only two independent nations in the Americas  (along with Canada) to designate French as an official language; the  other French-speaking areas are all overseas départements, or  collectivités, of France.With 10.4 million people, Haiti is the most  populous full member-state of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The  country is also a member of the Latin Union. In 2012, Haiti announced  its intention to seek associate membership status in the African Union.  It is the poorest country in the Americas as measured by the Human  Development Index. Political violence has occurred regularly throughout  its history, leading to government instability. Most recently, in  February 2004, a coup d''état originating in the north of the country  forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

The official language  is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language  in Europe.Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts,  Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was  laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád in the  Honfoglalás ("homeland-conquest"). His great-grandson Stephen I ascended  to the throne in 1000 AD, converting the country to a Christian  kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the  Western world. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Medieval Hungary  collapsed and succumbed to 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation  (1541–1699). Hungary eventually came under Habsburg rule, and later  formed a significant part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire  (1867–1918).Hungary''s current borders were first established by the  Treaty of Trianon (1920) after World War I, when the country lost 71% of  its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians.  Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World  War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Hungary came under  the influence of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the  establishment of a four-decade long communist dictatorship (1947–1989).  The country gained widespread international attention regarding the  Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted  border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the  Eastern Bloc.On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic  parliamentary republic, and is recognized today as a developed country.  Hungary is a popular tourist destination attracting 10.2 million  tourists a year (2011).

The Indonesian economy is the  world''s 16th largest by nominal GDP.The Indonesian archipelago has been  an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya  and then later Majapahit traded with China and India. Local rulers  gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from  the early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished.

The state shares its only land border with Northern  Ireland, one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. It is  surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south,  Saint George''s Channel to the south east, and the Irish Sea to the east.  It is a unitary, parliamentary republic with an elected president  serving as head of state. The head of government, the Taoiseach, is  nominated by the lower house of parliament, Dáil Éireann.Following the  Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, Ireland  gained effective independence from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free  State in 1922. Northern Ireland exercised an option called the Ulster  Month to remain in the United Kingdom. Initially a dominion within the  British Empire (later the Commonwealth of Nations), the Free State  received official British recognition of full legislative independence  in the Statute of Westminster of 1931. A new constitution was adopted in  1937, by which the name of the state became Ireland. In 1949 the  remaining duties of the king — defined by the Executive Authority  (External Relations) Act 1936 — were removed and Ireland was declared a  republic under the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. The state had no formal  relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century, but  since 1999 the two have co-operated on a number of policy areas under  the North-South Ministerial Council created by the Good Friday  Agreement.Once one of western Europe''s poorest states, modern Ireland  now ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP  per capita. After joining the European Union (then called the European  Economic Community) in 1973, Ireland enacted a series of liberal  economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth. The country  achieved considerable prosperity from 1995 to 2007, during which it  became known as the Celtic Tiger. This was halted by an unprecedented  financial crisis that began in 2008, in conjunction with the concurrent  global economic crash.Although still recovering from its economic crash,  Ireland remains one of the world''s most prosperous nations. In 2011 and  2013, it was ranked as the seventh-most developed country in the world  by the United Nations Human Development Index. Ireland also performs  well in several metrics of national performance, including freedom of  the press, economic freedom and civil liberties.

In its Basic Laws Israel defines itself as a  Jewish and Democratic State; it is the world''s only Jewish-majority  state.On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly  recommended the adoption and implementation of the partition plan of  Mandatory Palestine. On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the Executive  Head of the World Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish  Agency for Palestine, declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in  Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel," a state independent  upon the termination of the British Mandate for Palestine, 15 May 1948.  Neighboring Arab armies invaded Palestine on the next day and fought the  Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring  Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai  Peninsula (between 1967 and 1982), part of South Lebanon (between 1982  and 2000), Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It annexed portions of  these territories, including East Jerusalem, but the border with the  West Bank is disputed.

The population of Israel, as defined by  the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, was estimated in 2014 to be  8,146,300 people, of whom 6,110,600 are Jewish, a large proportion of  whom come from mixed ethnic heritage. The country''s second largest group  are designated as Arabs, with 1,686,000 people (including the Druze and  most East Jerusalem Arabs).

Other minorities  include Maronites, Samaritans, Black Hebrew Israelites, other  Sub-Saharan Africans, Armenians, Circassians, Roma and others. Israel  also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and  asylum seekers from Africa and Asia.Israel is a representative democracy  with a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal  suffrage.

In 627, Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia. In the 9th century, the Norse began to settle there. Norse people from Scotland then established the Kingdom of the Isles. The King''s title would then carry the suffix, "and the Isles". Magnus III, the King of Norway, was also known as "King of Mann and the Isles" as part of the Hebrides civilization between 1099 and 1103. A Norse-Gaelic culture arose and the island came under Norse control. In 1266, the island became part of Scotland, as formalised by the Treaty of Perth. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England, the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399.

Comprising a land area of  1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), it is the second-largest nation in the  Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world; with over 77 million  inhabitants, Iran is the world''s 17th most populous nation. It is the  only country that has both a Caspian Sea and Indian Ocean coastline.  Iran has been of geostrategic importance because of its central location  in Eurasia and Western Asia and the Strait of Hormuz.Iran is home to  one of the world''s oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of  the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdom in 3200 – 2800 BCE. The Iranian  Medes unified the country into the first of many empires in 625 BCE,  after which it became the dominant cultural and political power in the  region. Iran reached the pinnacle of its power during the Achaemenid  Empire (First Persian Empire) founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BCE,  which at its greatest extent comprised major portions of the ancient  world, stretching from Thrace and Macedon on the northeastern border of  Greece in the west, to the Indus Valley in the east, making it the  largest empire the world had yet seen. The empire collapsed in 330 BCE  following the conquests of Alexander the Great. The area eventually  regained influence under the Parthian Empire and rose to prominence once  more after the establishment of the Sasanian dynasty (Neo-Persian  empire) in 224 CE, under which Iran became one of the leading powers in  the world along with the Byzantine Empire for the next four  centuries.Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism were largely replaced after  Rashidun Muslims invaded Persia in 633 CE, and conquered it by 651 CE.  Iran thereafter played a vital role in the subsequent Islamic Golden  Age, producing numerous influential scientists, scholars, artists, and  thinkers. The emergence in 1501 of the Safavid dynasty, which promoted  the Twelver school of thought as the official religion, marked one of  the most important turning points in Iranian and Muslim history. It also  culminated into tensions, which in 1514 led to the Battle of Chaldiran.  The Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906 established the nation''s  first parliament, which operated within a constitutional monarchy.  Following a coup d''état instigated by the UK and the US in 1953, Iran  gradually became autocratic. Growing dissent against foreign influence  and political repression culminated in the Iranian Revolution, which led  to the establishment of an Islamic republic on 1 April 1979.Tehran is  the capital and largest city, serving as the cultural, commercial, and  industrial center of the nation. Iran is a major regional and middle  power, exerting considerable influence in international energy security  and the world economy through its large reserves of fossil fuels, which  include the largest natural gas supply in the world and the  fourth-largest proven petroleum reserves. It hosts Asia''s fourth-largest  number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Globally, it ranks 8th in the  world for the amount of books published per year, and was ranked first  in scientific progress in the world in 2011.Iran is a founding member of  the UN, NAM, OIC and OPEC. Its unique political system, based on the  1979 constitution, combines elements of a parliamentary democracy with a  religious theocracy run by the country''s clergy, wherein the Supreme  Leader wields significant influence.

The country has a  population of 325,671 and a total area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi),  which makes it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The  capital and largest city is Reykjavík, with the surrounding areas in the  southwestern region of the country being home to two-thirds of the  country''s population. Reykjavík is the most northern capital in the  world. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior  consists mainly of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields,  mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea  through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a  temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic  Circle.According to Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in AD  874 when the chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent Norse  settler on the island. Others had visited the island earlier and stayed  over winter. During the following centuries, Norsemen settled Iceland,  bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. From 1262 to 1918, Iceland  was part of the Norwegian and later the Danish monarchies. The country  became independent in 1918 and a republic was declared in 1944.Until the  20th century, the Icelanders relied largely on fishing and agriculture,  and the country was one of the least developed in the region.  Industrialisation of the fisheries and aid through the United States''  Marshall Plan following World War II brought prosperity and, by the  1990s, Iceland had developed as one of the wealthiest and most developed  nations in the world. In 1994, Iceland became party to the European  Economic Area, which supported diversification of the economy into  economic and financial services. In 2008, affected by the worldwide  crisis, the nation''s entire banking system systemically failed,  resulting in substantial political unrest. In the wake of the crisis,  Iceland instituted "capital controls" that made it impossible for many  foreigners to get their money out of the country, causing a dispute with  foreign investors. The economy has since then made a significant  recovery.Iceland has a free-market economy with relatively low taxes  compared to other OECD countries. It maintains a Nordic social welfare  system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for  its citizens. Iceland ranks high in economic, political and social  stability and equality. In 2013, it was ranked as the 13th  most-developed country in the world by the United Nations'' Human  Development Index.Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation''s Norse  heritage. Most Icelanders are descendants of Norse and Gaelic settlers.  Icelandic, a North Germanic language, is descended from Old Norse and is  closely related to Faroese and some West Norwegian dialects. The  country''s cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine,  poetry, and the medieval Icelanders'' sagas.

To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian  Peninsula and the two biggest Mediterranean islands of Sicily and  Sardinia.Italian territory also includes the islands of Pantelleria, 60  km (37 mi) east of the Tunisian coast and 100 km (62 mi) southwest of  Sicily, and Lampedusa, at about 113 km (70 mi) from Tunisia and at 176  km (109 mi) from Sicily, in addition to many other smaller islands. The  sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within  Italy, while Campione d''Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.  Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely  temperate climate. With 60 million inhabitants, it is the 5th most  populous country in Europe. Italy is also the 4th-largest economy in the  European Union, 3rd in the Eurozone and 9th in the world (IMF,  2012).Italy''s capital and largest city, Rome, has for centuries been the  leading political and religious centre of Western civilisation, serving  as the capital of both the Roman Empire and Christianity. During the  Dark Ages, Italy endured cultural and social decline in the face of  repeated invasions by Germanic tribes, with Roman heritage being  preserved largely by Christian monks. Beginning around the 11th century,  various Italian cities, communes and maritime republics rose to great  prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking (indeed, modern  capitalism has its roots in Medieval Italy); concurrently, Italian  culture flourished, especially during the Renaissance, which produced  many notable scholars, artists, and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci,  Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. Meanwhile, Italian explorers  such as Polo, Columbus, Vespucci, and Verrazzano discovered new routes  to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age  of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy would remain fragmented into numerous  warring states for the rest of the Middle Ages, subsequently falling  prey to larger European powers such as France, Spain, and later Austria.  Italy would thus enter a long period of decline that lasted until the  beginning of the 18th century.After many unsuccessful attempts, the  second and the third wars of Italian independence resulted in the  unification of most of present-day Italy between 1859 and 1866. From the  late 19th century to the early 20th century, the new Kingdom of Italy  rapidly industrialized and acquired a colonial empire becoming a Great  Power. However, Southern and rural Italy remained largely excluded from  industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora. Despite  victory in World War I as one of the Big Four with permanent membership  in the security council of the League of Nations, Italy entered a period  of economic crisis and social turmoil, which favoured the establishment  of a Fascist dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in  World War II, at the side of Nazi Germany and Japan forming the Axis  Alliance, ended in military defeat, economic destruction and civil war.  In the years that followed, Italy abolished the monarchy, reinstated  democracy, and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, thus becoming one of  the most developed nations in the world, with the fifth largest economy  by nominal GDP by the early 1990s. Italy was a founding member of NATO  in 1949 and one of the Inner Six of the European Community in 1957,  which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and has  been a member of the Eurozone since 1999.Italy is considered to be both a  major regional power and a leading middle power, with membership in  prominent institutions such as the UN, the EU, the NATO, the OECD, the  OSCE, the DAC, the WTO, the G6, G7, G8, G10, G20, the Union for the  Mediterranean, the Latin Union, the Council of Europe, the Central  European Initiative and the Uniting for Consensus.

The characters that make up Japan''s  name mean "sun-origin", which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as  the "Land of the Rising Sun".Japan is an archipelago of 6,852 islands.  The four largest islands are Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku,  which together comprise about ninety-seven percent of Japan''s land area.  Japan has the world''s tenth-largest population, with over 126 million  people. Honshū''s Greater Tokyo Area, which includes the de facto capital  city of Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the largest  metropolitan area in the world, with over 30 million  residents.Archaeological research indicates that people lived in Japan  as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of  Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century AD. Influence  from other nations followed by long periods of isolation has  characterized Japan''s history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan  was ruled by successive feudal military shogunates in the name of the  Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th  century, which was only ended in 1853 when a United States fleet  pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal  conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored  as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with  the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early  20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the  Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire  during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War  of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end  in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since  adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a  unitary constitutional monarchy with an emperor and an elected  legislature called the Diet.A major economic power, Japan has the  world''s third-largest economy by nominal GDP and the world''s  fourth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It is also the  world''s fourth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer. Although  Japan has officially renounced its right to declare war, it maintains a  modern military with the world''s fifth largest military budget, used for  self-defense and peacekeeping roles.

The official religion is  Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced by approximately 95% of the  Cambodian population. The country''s minority groups include Vietnamese,  Chinese, Chams, and 30 hill tribes. The capital and largest city is  Phnom Penh, the political, economic, and cultural center of Cambodia.  The kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with Norodom Sihamoni, a  monarch chosen by the Royal Throne Council, as head of state. The head  of government is Hun Sen, who is currently the longest serving non-royal  leader in South East Asia and has ruled Cambodia for over 25  years.Cambodia''s ancient name is "Kambuja" (Sanskrit: कंबुज). In 802 AD,  Jayavarman II declared himself king marking the beginning of the Khmer  Empire which flourished for over 600 years allowing successive kings to  dominate much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth.  The Indianized kingdom built monumental temples including Angkor Wat,  now a World Heritage Site, and facilitated the spread of first Hinduism,  then Buddhism to much of Southeast Asia. After the fall of Angkor to  Ayutthaya in the 15th century, Cambodia was then ruled as a vassal  between its neighbors.Cambodia became a protectorate of France in 1863,  Cambodia later gained independence in 1953.The Vietnam War extended into  Cambodia, during which the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh in 1975 and  later carried out the Cambodian Genocide from 1975-1979 when they were  ousted by Vietnam and then fought against the Vietnamese backed People''s  Republic of Kampuchea in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War (1979-1991).  Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords Cambodia was governed briefly by a  United Nations mission (1992-1993). The UN withdrew after holding  elections in which around 90% of the registered voters cast ballots. The  1997 coup placed power solely in the hands of Prime Minister Hun Sen  and the Cambodian People''s Party who remain in power as of 2013.Since  the reestablishment of democracy, Cambodia still faces numerous  challenges and sociopolitical issues that stunt its development as a  nation. In 2013, Cambodia scored a 20 out of a scale of a 100 (highly  clean) to 0 (highly corrupt) on the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index,  which also ranked the nation as the a ranking of 160 out of 175 nations  (tied with other nations) making the nation one of the most corrupt in  the world and Cambodia is the 2nd most corrupt nation in Asia with North  Korea being the 1st. According to Freedom House in their 2013 report  Cambodia scored a 5.5 out of a scale of 1 (Free) to 7 (Not Free)  indicating that Cambodia as a nation is ''Not Free''. As of 2013, the  Human Development Index (HDI) ranks Cambodia 138th place (tied with  Laos) making the nation one of the lowest ranking in terms of human  development and that it indicates that Cambodia has lower medium to low  development presently. Cambodia is a low income economy with it having  one of the lowest annual incomes in the world with the agriculture  sector dominating the country''s economy, followed by the service and  industrial sectors. According to the Global Hunger Index, Cambodia  currently ranks as the 32nd hungriest nation in the world out of the  list of the 56 nations with the worst hunger situation(s) in the  world.Despite these challenges, Cambodia has since had one of the best  economic records in Asia, with economic growth averaging 6 percent for  the last 10 years. Strong textiles, agriculture, construction, garments,  and tourism sectors led to foreign investments and international trade.  Oil and natural gas deposits found beneath Cambodia''s territorial  waters in 2005 remain mostly untapped, due in part to territorial  disputes with Thailand."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambodia', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khmer_language', 2776, '', '138', 2013, 'Cambodia (/kæmˈboʊdiə/; Khmer: កម្ពុជា, Kampuchea, IPA: [kɑmˈpuˈciə]), officially known as the Kingdom of Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា, Preăh Réachéanachâk Kâmpŭchéa) and once known as the Khmer Empire, is a country located in the southern portion of the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia.', 'http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flag_of_Cambodia.svg?width=300', 'http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Flag_of_Cambodia.svg'),

Other countries near the  Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the  northeast. Its capital is Moroni, on Grande Comore.At 1,862 km2 (719 sq  mi), excluding the contested island of Mayotte, the Comoros is the  third-smallest African nation by area. The population, excluding  Mayotte, is estimated at 798,000. Although speculated today by Arab  countries that the name Comoros originated from Arab people who arrived  in the islands much later, the name "Comoros" actually came from ancient  Polynesian, Melanesian and Australian people who settled among the  original African population B.C. "Comoros" was taken from the ancient  Polynesian word "Chammoras", one of their other settlements.[citation  needed] These inhabitants had their own distinct language "Comorian"  which was partly affected by the Arabs who arrived much later. The Union  of the Comoros has three official languages – Comorian, Arabic and  French – although French is the sole official language on  Mayotte.Officially, in addition to many smaller islands, the country  consists of the four major islands in the volcanic Comoros archipelago:  northwesternmost Grande Comore (Ngazidja); Mohéli (Mwali); Anjouan  (Nzwani); and southeasternmost Mayotte (Maore). Mayotte, however, has  never been administered by the Comoros government (or, before  independence, its predecessors). Instead, Mayotte continues to be  administered by France (currently as an overseas department) as it was  the only island in the archipelago that voted against independence in  1974.

The name Korea is derived from  Goryeo, a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. The capital and  largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China  to the north and north-west, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers. A  small section of the Tumen River also forms North Korea''s short border  with Russia to the northeast. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the  boundary between North Korea and South Korea. The legitimacy of this  border is not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the  legitimate government of the entire peninsula.The Korean Peninsula was  governed by the Korean Empire from the late 19th century to the early  20th century, until it was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After  the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Japanese rule  ceased. The Korean Peninsula was divided into two occupied zones in  1945, with the northern part of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet  Union and the southern portion by the United States. A United  Nations-supervised election held in 1948 led to the creation of separate  Korean governments for the two occupation zones: the Democratic  People''s Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in  the south. The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War  in 1950. An armistice in 1953 committed both to a cease-fire, but the  two countries remain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was  never signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in  1991.Although the DPRK officially describes itself as a Juche  Korean-style socialist republic and elections are held, it is widely  considered a dictatorship that has been described as totalitarian and  Stalinist with an elaborate cult of personality around the Kim family.  The Workers'' Party of Korea, led by a member of the ruling family, holds  de facto power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are  required to be a member. Juche, an ideology of self-reliance initiated  by the country''s first President, Kim Il-sung, became the official state  ideology, replacing Marxism–Leninism, when the country adopted a new  constitution in 1972. In 2009, references to Communism (Chosŏn''gŭl:  공산주의) were removed from the country''s constitution.The means of  production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and  collectivized farms, and most services such as healthcare, education,  housing and food production are state funded or subsidized. In the 1990s  North Korea suffered from a famine and continues to struggle with food  production. In 2013, the UN identified North Korean government policies  as the primary cause of the shortages and estimated that 16 million  people required food aid. North Korea''s health care system has been a  subject of controversy: the World Health Organization described it as  "the envy of the developing world" while Amnesty International claims  that it suffers from barely functioning hospitals, poor hygiene and  epidemics.North Korea follows Songun, or "military-first" policy in  order to strengthen the country and its government. It is the world''s  most militarized society, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and  paramilitary personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the 4th  largest in the world, after China, the U.S., and India. It is a  nuclear-weapons state and has an active space program. As a result of  its isolation, it is sometimes known as the "hermit kingdom". The  Economist Intelligence Unit ranked it as the lowest country in the  Democracy Index. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN''s  commission on human rights in North Korea report of severe restrictions  on human rights and crimes against humanity ''without parallel in the  modern world''.

Roughly  half of the country''s 50 million people reside in the metropolitan area  surrounding its capital, the Seoul Capital Area, which is the second  largest in the world with over 25 million residents.Archaeology  indicates that the Korean Peninsula was occupied by the Lower  Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the  founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC by the legendary Dangun. Following the  unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Silla AD 668, Korea was  ruled by the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) and Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910).  It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War  II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupation. An  election held in the U.S. zone in 1948 led to the creation of the  Republic of Korea. Although the United Nations passed a resolution  declaring the Republic to be the only lawful government in Korea, a  communist government was soon set up in the North that invaded the South  in 1950, leading to the Korean War that ended de facto in 1953.Between  1962 and 1994, the South Korean economy grew at an average of 10%  annually, fueled by annual export growth of 20%, in a period called the  Miracle on the Han River that rapidly transformed it into an affluent  G-20 major economy and the world''s seventh largest country in  international trade. Civilian government replaced military rule in 1987  and the country has since become Asia''s most advanced democracy as rated  by The Economist''s Democracy Index. In 2009, South Korea became the  world''s first former aid recipient to join the OECD''s Development  Assistance Committee, graduating to a major donor. Today, it is Asia''s  second largest donor, sending $1.74 billion of aid to the developing  world in 2013.South Korea is a developed country with the world''s 12th  highest living standard, having a HDI of 0.909. South Koreans are the  wealthiest in Asia in terms of average earnings and household income and  the South Korean economy is Asia''s fourth largest and the world''s 15th  (nominal) or 12th (purchasing power parity) largest. A world leader in  innovation as measured in the Global Innovation Quotient, South Korea is  the world''s sixth largest exporter, driven by chaebols such as Samsung,  Hyundai-Kia and LG.

In the  early 20th century, Kuwait declined in regional economic importance and  by 1934, Kuwait had lost its prominence in long-distance trade.  Kuwait''s economy was devastated by several trade blockades; before these  blockades Kuwait was prosperous.During World War I, the British Empire  imposed a trade blockade against Kuwait because Kuwait''s ruler supported  the Ottoman Empire.

Kazakhstan is the world''s largest landlocked  country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world; its  territory of 2,727,300 square kilometres (1,053,000 sq mi) is larger  than Western Europe. It has borders with (clockwise from the north)  Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and also  adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea. The terrain of Kazakhstan  includes flatlands, steppe, taiga, rock canyons, hills, deltas,  snow-capped mountains, and deserts. With 17 million people (2013  estimate) Kazakhstan has the 62nd largest population in the world,  though its population density is less than 6 people per square kilometre  (15 people per sq. mi.). The capital is Astana, where it was moved from  Almaty in 1997.The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been  inhabited by nomadic tribes. This changed in the 13th century, when  Genghis Khan occupied the country. When his ruling family fought for  power, power generally switched back to the nomads. By the 16th century,  the Kazakhs emerged as a distinct group, divided into three jüz  (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The Russians began  advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the  mid-19th century all of Kazakhstan was part of the Russian Empire.  Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, and subsequent civil war, the  territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times before becoming  the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, a part of the Soviet  Union.Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare  independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991; the  current President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been leader of the country  since 1991. Nazarbayev maintains strict[citation needed] control over  the country''s politics. Since independence, Kazakhstan has pursued a  balanced foreign policy and worked to develop its economy, especially  its hydrocarbon industry.Kazakhstan is ethnically and culturally  diverse, in part due to mass deportations of many ethnic groups to the  country during Joseph Stalin''s rule. Kazakhstan has a population of 17.7  million, with 131 ethnicities, including Kazakh, Russian, Ukrainian,  German, Uzbek, Tatar, and Uyghur. Around 63% of the population are  Kazakhs. Kazakhstan allows freedom of religion. Kazakhstan has been  quite a religiously tolerant nation, but has lately come under  international criticism for lack of religious freedom. Robert George,  the chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom  stated in 2013: "the harsh application of highly restrictive laws that  were adopted two years ago, have [sic] damaged Kazakhstan''s  international standing and resulted in many Kazakh citizens'' religious  freedoms being violated."

Its  population was estimated to be around 6.5 million in 2012.A third of the  population of Laos live below the international poverty line which  means living on less than US$1.25 per day. Laos is a low income economy  with it having one of the lowest annual incomes in the world. In 2013,  Laos ranked the 138th place (tied with Cambodia) on the Human  Development Index (HDI), indicating that Laos currently only has lower  medium to low development.

Laos has had a poor human rights record most particularly dealing with  the nation''s acts of genocide being committed towards its Hmong  population.Laos traces its history to the kingdom of Lan Xang, which  existed from the 14th to the 18th century when it split into three  separate kingdoms. In 1893, it became a French protectorate, with the  three kingdoms, Luang Phrabang, Vientiane and Champasak, uniting to form  what is now known as Laos. It briefly gained independence in 1945 after  Japanese occupation, but returned to French rule until it was granted  autonomy in 1949. Laos became independent in 1953, with a constitutional  monarchy under Sisavang Vong. Shortly after independence, a long civil  war ended the monarchy, when the Communist Pathet Lao movement came to  power in 1975.Laos is a single-party socialist republic. It espouses  Marxism and is governed by a single party communist politburo dominated  by military generals. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam  People''s Army continue to have significant influence in Laos. The  capital city is Vientiane. Other large cities include Luang Prabang,  Savannakhet, and Pakse. The official language is Lao. Laos is a  multi-ethnic country with the politically and culturally dominant Lao  people making up approximately 60% of the population, mostly in the  lowlands. Various Mon-Khmer groups, the Hmong, and other indigenous hill  tribes, accounting for 40% of the population, live in the foothills and  mountains.

It is  bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south.  Lebanon''s location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the  Arabian hinterland has dictated its rich history and shaped a cultural  identity of religious and ethnic diversity.The earliest evidence of  civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years,  predating recorded history. Lebanon was the home of the Phoenicians, a  maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years (c. 1550–539  BC). In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire, and  eventually became one of the Empire''s leading centers of Christianity.  In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite  Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the  Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new  religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount Lebanon as  well, a religious divide that would last for centuries. During the  Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic  Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established  with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era.The  region eventually came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, a political  empire that which came to power from 1299-1923. Following the collapse  of the Empire after World War I, the five provinces that constitute  modern Lebanon were mandated to France. The French expanded the borders  of Mount Lebanon, which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze, to  include more Muslims. Lebanon gained independence in 1943, establishing a  unique political system – "confessionalism" – that is a power-sharing  mechanism based on religious communities. Bechara El Khoury (independent  Lebanon''s first president), Riad El-Solh (Lebanon''s first prime  minister) and Emir Majid Arslan (Lebanon''s first minister of defence)  are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are  national heroes for having led the country''s independence. French troops  withdrew from Lebanon in 1946.Before the Lebanese Civil War  (1975–1990), the country experienced a period of relative calm and  renowned prosperity, driven by tourism, agriculture, commerce, and  banking. Because of its financial power and diversity, Lebanon was known  in its heyday as "the Switzerland of the East". It attracted so many  tourists that the capital, Beirut, was referred to as "the Paris of the  Middle East". At the end of the war, there were extensive efforts to  revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lebanon', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabic_language', 15985, '67', '72', 2013, 'Lebanon (/ˈlɛbənɒn/ or /ˈlɛbənən/; Arabic: لبنان‎ Libnān or Lubnān; Lebanese Arabic: [lɪbˈneːn]; Aramaic: לבנאנ), officially the Lebanese Republic (Arabic: الجمهورية اللبنانية‎ Al-Jumhūrīyah Al-Libnānīyah; Lebanese Arabic: [elˈʒʊmhuːɾɪjje l.ˈlɪbneːnɪjje]), is a democratic republic country bordering the East Mediteranean Sea.

Beginning in  1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were  freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as  Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the  American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders  thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African  captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent  there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin. In  1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a  government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital  city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United  States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and  their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political,  social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the  nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.The country began to  modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during  World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman.  Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the  Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the  Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and  economic instability and two successive civil wars.

As a consequence of the Soviet occupation both countries are  home to a large number of ethnic Russians (26.9% in Latvia and 25.5% in  Estonia) of whom some are non-citizens. Latvia is historically  predominantly Protestant Lutheran, except for the Latgale region in the  southeast, which has historically been predominantly Roman Catholic.The  Republic of Latvia was founded on 18 November 1918. However, its de  facto independence was interrupted at the outset of World War II. In  1940, the country was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union,  invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941, and re-occupied by the  Soviets in 1944 to form the Latvian SSR for the next fifty years. The  peaceful Singing Revolution, starting in 1987, called for Baltic  emancipation of Soviet rule. It ended with the dissolution of the Soviet  Union in 1991, and Latvia declared the restoration of its de facto  independence on 21 August 1991.Latvia is a member of NATO, European  Union, United Nations, Council of Europe, CBSS, IMF, NB8, NIB, OSCE, WTO  and OECD. For 2013, Latvia is listed 44th on the Human Development  Index and as a high income country. It used the Latvian lats as its  currency until this was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2014."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latvia', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia', 'ευρώ (Greek), евро (Bulgarian)', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latvian_language', 22150, '49', '44', 2013, 'Latvia /ˈlætviə/ (Latvian: Latvija) officially the Republic of Latvia (Latvian: Latvijas Republika), is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe.

The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the  fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller  peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the  supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from India around 88 million  years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative  isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90  percent of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island''s  diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the  encroachment of the rapidly growing human population.Initial human  settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and AD 550 by  Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo. These  were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique  Channel. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each  one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy  ethnic group is often divided into eighteen or more sub-groups of which  the largest are the Merina of the central highlands.Until the late 18th  century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment  of shifting socio-political alliances. Beginning in the early 19th  century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of  Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles. The monarchy collapsed in 1897  when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which  the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of  Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed  Republics. Since 1992 the nation has officially been governed as a  constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a  popular uprising in 2009 the last elected president Marc Ravalomanana  was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009  to Andry Rajoelina in a move widely viewed by the international  community as a coup d''état.In 2012, the population of Madagascar was  estimated at just over 22 million, 90 percent of whom live on less than  two dollars per day. Malagasy and French are both official languages of  the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional  beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and  agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and  private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar''s development  strategy.

The most populous atoll is Majuro, which also acts as the  capital.Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands  during the 2nd millennium BC, with inter-island navigation made possible  using traditional stick charts. Islands in the archipelago were first  explored by Europeans in the 1520s, with Spanish explorer Alonso de  Salazar sighting an atoll in August 1526. Other expeditions by Spanish  and English ships followed, with the islands'' current name stemming from  British explorer John Marshall. Recognised as part of the Spanish East  Indies in 1874, the islands were sold to Germany in 1884, and became  part of German New Guinea in 1885. The Empire of Japan occupied the  Marshall Islands in World War I, which were later joined with other  former German territories in 1919 by the League of Nations to form the  South Pacific Mandate. In World War II, the islands were conquered by  the United States in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Along  with other Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands were then consolidated  into the United-States-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.  Self-government was achieved in 1979, and full sovereignty in 1986,  under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.Politically,  the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with  the United States, with the US providing defense, funding grants, and  access to social services. Having few natural resources, the islands''  wealth is based on a service economy, as well as some fishing and  agriculture, with a large percentage of the islands'' gross domestic  product coming from United States aid.

Other cities include Bitola, Kumanovo, Prilep, Tetovo, Ohrid, Veles, Štip, Kočani, Gostivar, Kavadarci and Strumica. It has more than 50 lakes and sixteen mountains higher than 2,000 m (6,562 ft).

Its size is just  over 1,240,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) with a population of  14.5 million. Its capital is Bamako.Mali consists of eight regions and  its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara, while  the country''s southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live,  features the Niger and Senegal rivers. The country''s economic structure  centers on agriculture and fishing. Some of Mali''s prominent natural  resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the  African continent, and salt. About half the population lives below the  international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.Present-day Mali was once  part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade:  the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire (for which Mali is named), and the  Songhai Empire. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of  mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, Mali  covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France, and stretched  to the west coast of Africa. In the late 19th century, during the  Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of  French Sudan. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined  with Senegal in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali  Federation. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal''s withdrawal from the  federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent  Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a 1991 coup led  to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a  democratic, multi-party state.In January 2012, an armed conflict broke  out in northern Mali, which Tuareg rebels took control of by April and  declared the secession of a new state, Azawad. The conflict was  complicated by a military coup that took place in March and later  fighting between Tuareg and Islamist rebels. In response to Islamist  territorial gains, the French military launched Opération Serval in  January 2013. A month later, Malian and French forces recaptured most of  the north.

One third of Burma''s total perimeter of 1,930 kilometres (1,200 miles) forms an uninterrupted coastline along the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. Burma''s population of over 60 million makes it the world''s 24th most populous country and, at 676,578 square kilometres (261,227 sq mi), it is the world''s 40th largest country and the second largest in Southeast Asia.Early civilizations in Burma included the Tibeto-Burman speaking Pyu in Upper Burma and the Mon in Lower Burma. In the 9th century, the Burmans of the Kingdom of Nanzhao entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and, following the establishment of the Pagan Empire in the 1050s, the Burmese language and culture slowly became dominant in the country. During this period, Theravada Buddhism gradually became the predominant religion of the country. The Pagan Empire fell due to the Mongol invasions (1277–1301), and several warring states emerged. In the second half of the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty, the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Burma and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well. The British conquered Burma after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony (a part of India until 1937 and then a separately administered colony). Burma became an independent nation in 1948, initially as a democratic nation and then, following a coup in 1962, a military dictatorship which formally ended in 2011.For most of its independent years, the country has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and a myriad of Burma''s ethnic groups have been involved in one of the world''s longest-running unresolved civil wars. During this time, the United Nations and several other organizations have reported consistent and systematic human rights violations in the country. In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. Although the military retains enormous influence through the constitution that was ratified in 2008, it has taken steps toward relinquishing control of the government. This, along with the release of Burma''s most prominent human rights activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, and many other political prisoners, has improved the country''s human rights record and foreign relations and has led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions that had been imposed by the European Union and the United States. There is, however, continuing criticism of the government''s treatment of the largely Muslim ethnic Rohingya minority and its poor response to the religious clashes that have occurred throughout the nation, described by various human rights organizations as a policy of ethnic cleansing.Burma is a country rich in jade and gems, oil, natural gas and other mineral resources. In 2011, its GDP stood at US$53.14 billion and was estimated to be growing at an annual rate of 5.5%. Despite good economic growth it''s believed that Burma''s true economic potential won''t be easily achieved due to the nation''s lack of development, as of 2013 according to the Human Development Index (HDI) Burma still has one of the lowest human development in the world.', 'http://dbpedia.org/page/Burma', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma', 'Kyat', 'Burmese', 1700, '169', '150', 2014, 'Burma (/ˈbɜrmə/ BUR-mə), officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, commonly shortened to Myanmar (/ˈmjɑːnˌmɑr/ MYAHN-mar, /ˈmaɪænmɑr/ or /ˈmjænmɑr/), is a sovereign state in Southeast Asia bordered by Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand.

In 1206, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire, and his  grandson Kublai Khan conquered China to establish the Yuan Dynasty.  After the collapse of the Yuan, the Mongols retreated to Mongolia and  resumed their earlier pattern of factional conflict and occasional raids  on the Chinese borderlands. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Mongolia  came under the influence of Tibetan Buddhism.At the end of the 17th  century, all of Mongolia had been incorporated into the area ruled by  the Manchu''s Qing Dynasty. During the collapse of the Qing Dynasty the  Mongols established Temporary Government of Khalkha in 30 November 1911.  On 29 December 1911 Mongolia declared independence from the Qing  Dynasty and this National Liberation Revolution ended the Manchu''s rule  that lasted 220 years (153 years after the collapse of the Zunghar  Khanate).The country came under Soviet influence, resulting in the  proclamation of the Mongolian People''s Republic as a Soviet satellite  state in 1924. After the breakdown of communist regimes in Europe in  late 1989, Mongolia saw its own democratic revolution in early 1990; it  led to a multi-party system, a new constitution of 1992, and transition  to a market economy.At 1,564,116 square kilometres (603,909 sq mi),  Mongolia is the 19th largest and the most sparsely populated independent  country in the world, with a population of around 2.9 million people.

The territory''s economy is heavily dependent on gambling and tourism, but also includes manufacturing. The Cantonese people from Hong Kong and Guangdong, especially recent mainland tourism from Mandarin-speaking regions, have boosted the economy of Macau significantly.A former Portuguese colony, Macau was administered by Portugal from the mid-16th century until late 1999, when it was the last remaining European colony in Asia. Portuguese traders first settled in Macau in the 1550s. In 1557, Macau was rented to Portugal by the Chinese empire as a trading port. The Portuguese administered the city under Chinese authority and sovereignty until 1887, when Macau became a colony of the Portuguese empire.

Malta gained independence from the  United Kingdom in 1964 and became a republic in 1974. Malta was admitted  to the United Nations in 1964 and to the European Union in 2004; in  2008, it became part of the eurozone.Malta has a long Christian legacy  and its Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta is sometimes traditionally  claimed to be an Apostolic see because, according to the Acts of the  Apostles, Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on Malta. Catholicism is the  official religion in Malta.Malta is a favoured tourist destination with  its warm climate, numerous recreational areas, and architectural and  historical monuments, including nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Hal  Saflieni Hypogeum, Valletta and seven Megalithic Temples which are some  of the oldest free-standing structures in the world."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malta', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language', 27022, '', '32', 2013, 'Malta /ˈmɒltə/ (Maltese: Repubblika ta'' Malta, pronounced [rɛˈpʊbb.lɪ.kɐ ˈtɐ ˈmɐl.tɐ]) is a southern European country in the Mediterranean Sea.

In the mid-16th century, for fifteen years, the  Maldives was dominated by the Portuguese Empire. In the mid-17th  century, the Dutch Empire (Malabar) dominated Maldives for four months.  Finally, in the late 19th century, on the brink of war, the Maldives  became a British protectorate from 1887 until 1965.

Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi''s  largest city; the second largest is Blantyre and the third is Mzuzu. The  name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people  that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed "The Warm Heart of  Africa".The area of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating  Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area  was colonized by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as Nyasaland,  became part of the semi-independent central African Federation (CAF).  The Federation was dissolved in 1963 and in 1964, Nyasaland gained full  independence and was renamed Malawi. Upon gaining independence it became  a single-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who  remained president until 1994, when he was ousted from power. Joyce  Banda (no relation) is the current president, raised to that position  after president Bingu wa Mutharika died in 2012. She is the first female  president in Malawi. (see also Rose Chibambo for examples of women  political leaders in Malawi). Malawi has a democratic, multi-party  government. Malawi has a small military force that includes an army, a  navy and an air wing. Malawi''s foreign policy is pro-Western and  includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and  participation in several international organisations.Malawi is among the  world''s least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in  agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian government  depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this  need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian  government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy,  improving education, health care, environmental protection, and becoming  financially independent. Malawi has several programs developed since  2005 that focus on these issues, and the country''s outlook appears to be  improving, with improvements in economic growth, education and  healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.Malawi has a low life expectancy and  high infant mortality. There is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which is a  drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a  diverse population of native peoples, Asians and Europeans, with several  languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was  periodic regional conflict fueled in part by ethnic divisions in the  past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a  Malawian nationality had reemerged.

Mexico is a federation comprising thirty-one states and a  Federal District, the capital city.In pre-Columbian Mexico many cultures  matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec, the Toltec, the  Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, the Maya and the Aztec before first contact  with Europeans. In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the  territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered  as the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This territory would eventually become  Mexico following recognition of the colony''s independence in 1821. The  post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, the  Mexican-American War that led to the territorial cession to the United  States, the Pastry War, the Franco-Mexican War, a civil war, two empires  and a domestic dictatorship. The latter led to the Mexican Revolution  in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution  and the emergence of the country''s current political system. In March  1938, through the Mexican oil expropriation private U.S. and Anglo-Dutch  oil companies were nationalized to create the state-owned Pemex oil  company.Mexico has one of the world''s largest economies, it is the tenth  largest oil producer in the world, the largest silver producer in the  world and is considered both a regional power and middle power. In  addition, Mexico was the first Latin American member of the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD (since 1994), and  considered an upper-middle income country by the World Bank. Mexico is  considered a newly industrialized country and an emerging power. It has  the fourteenth largest nominal GDP and the tenth largest GDP by  purchasing power parity. The economy is strongly linked to those of its  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, especially the  United States of America. Mexico ranks sixth in the world and first in  the Americas by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites with 32, and in  2010 was the tenth most visited country in the world with 22.5 million  international arrivals per year.

The British set up  administrative and legal structures while retaining traditional  chiefdoms. Nigeria became independent in 1960, but plunged into civil  war several years later. It has since alternated between  democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships,  with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be  conducted reasonably free and fair.Nigeria is often referred to as the  "the Giant of Africa", due to its large population and economy. With  around 174 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in  Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. The country  is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are  the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba.Nigeria is roughly divided in half between  Christians, who mostly live in the Southern and central parts of the  country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the North and South-West.

The country is situated between  11 and 14 degrees north of the Equator in the Northern Hemisphere, which  places it entirely within the tropics. The Pacific Ocean lies to the  west, and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The country''s physical  geography divides it into three major zones: Pacific lowlands; wet,  cooler central highlands; and the Caribbean lowlands. On the Pacific  side of the country are the two largest fresh water lakes in Central  America—Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua. Surrounding these lakes and  extending to their northwest along the rift valley of the Gulf of  Fonseca are fertile lowland plains, with soil highly enriched by ash  from nearby volcanoes of the central highlands. Nicaragua''s abundance of  biologically significant and unique ecosystems contribute to  Mesoamerica''s designation as a biodiversity hotspot.The Spanish Empire  conquered the region in the 16th century. Nicaragua achieved its  independence from Spain in 1821. Since its independence, Nicaragua has  undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, and fiscal  crisis—the most notable causes that led to the Nicaraguan Revolution of  the 1960s and 1970s. Nicaragua is a representative democratic republic,  and has experienced economic growth and political stability in recent  years. Since 2007, Daniel Ortega has been the President.The population  of Nicaragua, approximately 6 million, is multiethnic. Its capital,  Managua, is the third-largest city in Central America. Segments of the  population include indigenous native tribes from the Mosquito Coast,  Europeans, Africans, Asians, and people of Middle Eastern origin. The  main language is Spanish, although native tribes on the eastern coast  speak their native languages, such as Miskito, Sumo, and Rama, as well  as English Creole. The mixture of cultural traditions has generated  substantial diversity in art and literature, particularly the latter  given the various literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and  writers, including Rubén Darío, Pablo Antonio Cuadra and Ernesto  Cardenal.

The European part of the Netherlands borders the North Sea to the north and west, Belgium to the south, and Germany to the east; and shares maritime borders with Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Netherlands was one of the first countries in the world to have an elected parliament, and is governed as a parliamentary democracy organised as a unitary state. The capital city of the Netherlands, mandated by the constitution, is Amsterdam; however, the seat of government is located in The Hague. The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to as "Holland", which in strict usage, refers only to North and South Holland, two of its provinces. The former usage is considered incorrect or informal, depending on the context, but is generally accepted when referring to the national football team.The Netherlands is a geographically low-lying country, with about 20% of its area and 21% of its population located below sea level, and 50% of its land lying less than one metre above sea level. This distinct feature contributes to the country''s name: in Dutch (Nederland), English, and many other European languages, its name literally means "Low Land" or "Low Countries." Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction that lowered the surface by several metres. Even in flooded areas, peat extraction continued through turf dredging. Beginning in the late 16th century, land reclamation started and large polder areas are now preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes, canals and pumping stations. Nearly 17% of the country''s land area is reclaimed from the sea. Much of the Netherlands is formed by the estuary of three important European rivers, which together with their distributaries form the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta. Most of the country is very flat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast and several low hill ranges in the central parts.The Netherlands is a founding member of the EU, G-10, NATO, OECD, WTO and a part of the trilateral Benelux economic union. The country is host to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague, as is the EU''s criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation agency Eurojust. This has led to the city being dubbed "the world''s legal capital". The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom. It had the tenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2011. In May 2011, the Netherlands was ranked as the "happiest" country in the world according to the OECD, reflecting its high standard of living.', 'http://dbpedia.org/page/Netherlands', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands', 'Euro', 'Dutch', 46440, '13', '4', 2014, 'The Netherlands (/ˈnɛðərləndz/; Dutch: Nederland [ˈneːdərˌlɑnt] ) is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, consisting of twelve provinces in western Europe and three islands in the Caribbean.

Norway has a total  area of 385,252 square kilometres (148,747 sq mi) and a population of  5,109,059 people. (01.01. 2014) It is the 2nd least densely populated  country in Europe. The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden  (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long), which is the longest uninterrupted border  within both Scandinavia & Europe at large. Norway is bordered by  Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak Strait to the  south, with Denmark on the other side. It shares maritime borders with  Russia by the Barents Sea; Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland by  the Norwegian Sea; and Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom by the  North Sea. Norway''s extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean  and the Barents Sea, is laced with fjords, a renowned part of its  landscape. The capital city Oslo is the largest in the nation, with a  population of 630,000. Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum,  natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, fresh water, and hydropower.Two  centuries of Viking raids to southern and western areas tapered off  following the adoption of Christianity in AD 994. Norway expanded its  control overseas to parts of Britain, Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland.  Norwegian power peaked in 1265, but competition from the Hanseatic  League and the spread of the Black Death weakened the country. In 1380,  Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four  centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to  Sweden and adopted a constitution. Sweden went to war with Norway but  agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the  union under a Swedish king. Later Norway demanded independence, which it  gained in a referendum in 1905. Norway remained neutral in World War I.  Despite its declaration of neutrality in World War II, Norway was  occupied for 5 years by forces of Nazi Germany. In 1949 it abandoned  neutrality, becoming a founding member of NATO. Discovery of oil in  adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway''s economic fortunes.  The country maintains a welfare model with universal health care,  subsidised higher education, and a comprehensive social security system.  Key domestic issues include maintaining the country''s extensive social  safety net with an aging population and preserving economic  competitiveness. The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of  the country''s gross domestic product.King Harald V is Norway''s head of  state and Erna Solberg became Prime Minister on 16 October 2013,  replacing Jens Stoltenberg, and the government made a shift from being a  labour to a conservative government. It has administrative subdivisions  on two levels, known as counties (fylke) and municipalities (kommuner).  The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and  influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and  the Finnmark Act. Norway maintains close ties with the European Union  and its member countries (despite rejecting full EU membership in two  referenda), as well as with the United States. Norway participates with  United Nations forces in international missions, notably in Afghanistan,  Kosovo, Sudan, and Libya. Norway is a founding member of the United  Nations, NATO, the Council of Europe, and the Nordic Council; a member  of the European Economic Area, the WTO and the OECD; and is also a part  of the Schengen Area.The country has the fourth-highest per capita  income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists, as well as  ninth-highest on a more comprehensive CIA list. On a per-capita basis,  it is the world''s largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the  Middle East, From 2001 to 2006, and then again from 2009 to 2012, Norway  had the highest Human Development Index ranking in the world. Norway  has also topped the Legatum Prosperity Index for the last five years.

After World War I, Nauru became a League of  Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United  Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, who  were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war  ended, the country entered into trusteeship again. Nauru gained its  independence in 1968.Nauru is a phosphate rock island with rich deposits  near the surface, which allow easy strip mining operations. It has some  phosphate resources which, as of 2011, are not economically viable for  extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any  sovereign state in the world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When  the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the environment had been  seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to  manage the island''s wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru  briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From  2001 to 2008, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange  for hosting the Nauru detention centre.The president of Nauru is Baron  Waqa, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament.

The country  geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island,  or Te Ika-a-Māui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamu – and numerous  smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres (900 mi)  east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres  (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and  Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be  settled by humans. During its long isolation, New Zealand developed a  distinctive biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life; most notable  are the large number of unique bird species. The country''s varied  topography and its sharp mountain peaks owe much to the tectonic uplift  of land and volcanic eruptions.Polynesians settled New Zealand in  1250–1300 CE and developed a distinctive Māori culture. Abel Tasman, a  Dutch explorer, was the first European to sight New Zealand in 1642 CE.  The introduction of potatoes and muskets triggered upheaval among Māori  early during the 19th century, which led to the inter-tribal Musket  Wars. In 1840 the British Crown and Māori signed the Treaty of Waitangi,  making New Zealand a British colony. Immigrant numbers increased  sharply and conflicts escalated into the New Zealand Wars, which  resulted in Māori land being confiscated in the mid North Island.  Economic depressions were followed by periods of political reform, with  women gaining the vote during the 1890s, and a welfare state being  established from the 1930s. After World War II, New Zealand joined  Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty, although  the United States later suspended the treaty as a result of New  Zealand''s adoption of a nuclear-free policy. New Zealanders enjoyed one  of the highest standards of living in the world in the 1950s, but the  1970s saw a deep recession, worsened by oil shocks and the United  Kingdom''s entry into the European Economic Community. The country  underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which transformed it  from a protectionist to a liberalised free trade economy; once-dominant  exports of wool have been overtaken by dairy products, meat, and  wine.The majority of New Zealand''s population is of European descent;  the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians and  Pacific Islanders. English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the  official languages, with English predominant. Much of New Zealand''s  culture is derived from Māori and early British settlers. Early European  art was dominated by landscapes and to a lesser extent portraits of  Māori. A recent resurgence of Māori culture has seen their traditional  arts of carving, weaving and tattooing become more mainstream. The  country''s culture has also been broadened by globalisation and increased  immigration from the Pacific Islands and Asia. New Zealand''s diverse  landscape provides many opportunities for outdoor pursuits and has  provided the backdrop for a number of big budget movies.New Zealand is  organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for  local government purposes; these have less autonomy than the country''s  long defunct provinces did. Nationally, legislative authority is vested  in a unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised  by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. Queen Elizabeth II is the  country''s head of state and is represented by a Governor-General. The  Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the  Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with  New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand''s  territorial claim in Antarctica.

It consists of 7,107 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Its capital city is Manila while its most populous city is Quezon City; both are part of Metro Manila.To the north of the Philippines across the Luzon Strait lies Taiwan; Vietnam sits west across the South China Sea; southwest is the island of Borneo across the Sulu Sea, and to the south the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia; while to the east it is bounded by the Philippine Sea and the island-nation of Palau. Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world''s greatest biodiversity. At approximately 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq mi), the Philippines is the 64th-largest country in the world.With a population of at least 99 million people, the Philippines is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world. An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas, comprising one of the world''s largest diasporas. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago''s earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Various nations were established under the rule of Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans. Trade with China, Malay, Indian, and Islamic states occurred.The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. With the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi in 1565, the first Spanish settlement in the archipelago was established, and the Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. This resulted in the predominant religion in the country being Roman Catholicism. During this time, Manila became the Asian hub of the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade.As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic, and the Philippine–American War. Aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands. After World War II, the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation.

With a  population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous  country in the world, the sixth most populous member of the European  Union, and the most populous post-communist member of the European  Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative  subdivisions.Many historians trace the establishment of a Polish state  to 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with  that of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. The Kingdom of  Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding  political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the  Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The  Commonwealth gradually ceased to exist in the years 1772–1795, when the  Polish territory was partitioned among Prussia, the Russian Empire, and  Austria. Poland regained its independence (as the Second Polish  Republic) at the end of World War I, in 1918.Two decades later, in  September 1939, World War II started with the invasions of Poland by  Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop  Pact). More than six million Polish citizens died in the war. In 1944, a  Soviet-backed Polish provisional government was formed, which, after a  period of conflict, falsified referendum and elections, gave rise to a  satellite state of the Soviet Union, Polish Republic (Rzeczpospolita  Polska), renamed to the People''s Republic of Poland (Polska  Rzeczpospolita Ludowa) in 1952. During the Revolutions of 1989, Poland''s  Marxist-Leninist government was overthrown and Poland adopted a new  constitution establishing itself as a democracy under the name  Rzeczpospolita Polska, often referred to as the "Third Polish Republic"  (III Rzeczpospolita).Despite the vast destruction the country  experienced during World War II, Poland managed to preserve much of its  cultural wealth. There are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO  World Heritage and 54 Historical Monuments and many objects of cultural  heritage.

It claims sovereignty over the Palestinian territories, and has designated Jerusalem as its capital. Most of the areas claimed for the State of Palestine have been occupied by Israel since 1967 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War, with the Palestinian Authority exercising socio-political administration since 1993 in limited areas. In 2012, it was granted observer status by the United Nations (UN).The October 1974 Arab League summit designated the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people" and reaffirmed "their right to establish an independent state of urgency." In November, PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the UN General Assembly granting them observer status as a "non-state entity" at the UN, After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially "acknowledged" the proclamation and decided to use the designation "Palestine" instead of "Palestine Liberation Organization" in the UN In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine''s government.In 1993, in the Oslo Accords, Israel acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as "representing the Palestinian people", in return for the PLO recognizing Israel''s right to exist in peace, acceptance of UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and its rejection of "violence and terrorism". As a result, in 1994 the PLO established the Palestinian National Authority (PNA or PA) territorial administration, that exercises some governmental functions in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In 2007, the Hamas takeover of Gaza Strip politically and territorially divided the Palestinians, with Abbas''s Fatah left largely ruling the West Bank and recognized internationally as the official Palestinian Authority, while Hamas has secured its control over the Gaza Strip. In April 2011, the Palestinian parties signed an agreement of reconciliation, but its implementation has stalled since.On 29 November 2012, in a 138-9 vote (with 41 abstentions and 5 absences), the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 67/19, upgrading Palestine from an "observer entity" to a "non-member observer state" within the United Nations system, and was described as de facto recognition of PLO''s sovereignty. The new status equates Palestine''s with that of the Holy See; similarly, Switzerland was a non-member observer state for more than 50 years (until 2002).The UN has permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as "The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations", and Palestine has instructed its diplomats to officially represent "The State of Palestine" — no longer the Palestinian National Authority. On 17 December 2012, UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon declared that ''the designation of "State of Palestine" shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents'', thus recognising the title ''State of Palestine'' as the nation''s official name for all UN purposes. As of 27 September 2013, 134 (700169400000000000069.4%) of the 193 member states of the United Nations have recognised the State of Palestine.

The  Celts and the Romans, followed by the Visigothic and Suebian domination,  and the Moorish invaders, who were eventually expelled during the  Reconquista.Portugal by 1139 established itself as an independent  kingdom from Galicia. In the 15th and 16th centuries, as the result of  pioneering the Age of Discovery, Portugal expanded western influence and  established the first global empire, becoming one of the world''s major  economic, political and military powers, and ultimately dividing the  world with Spain.The Portuguese Empire was the longest-lived of the  modern European colonial empires, spanning almost 600 years, from the  capture of Ceuta in 1415 to the handover of Macau to China in 1999 (de  facto) or the granting of sovereignty to East Timor in 2002 (de jure).  The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories that are now  part of 53 different sovereign states, leaving a legacy of over 250  million Portuguese speakers today (making it the sixth most spoken first  language) and a number of Portuguese-based creoles. Portugal''s  international status was greatly reduced during the 19th century,  especially following the Independence of Brazil, its largest and most  important colony.

The islands were first  visited by Europeans in the 18th century, and were made part of the  Spanish East Indies in 1885. Following Spain''s defeat in the  Spanish–American War in 1898, the islands were sold to Imperial Germany  in 1899 under the terms of the German–Spanish Treaty, where they were  administered as part of German New Guinea. The Imperial Japanese Navy  conquered Palau during World War I, and the islands were later made a  part of the Japanese-ruled South Pacific Mandate by the League of  Nations. During World War II, skirmishes, including the major Battle of  Peleliu, were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the  Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. Along with other Pacific Islands,  Palau was made a part of the United States-governed Trust Territory of  the Pacific Islands in 1947. Having voted against joining the Federated  States of Micronesia in 1979, the islands gained full sovereignty in  1994 under a Compact of Free Association with the United  States.Politically, Palau is a presidential republic in free association  with the United States, which provides defense, funding, and access to  social services. Legislative power is concentrated in the bicameral  Palau National Congress. Palau''s economy is based mainly on tourism,  subsistence agriculture and fishing, with a significant portion of gross  national product (GNP) derived from foreign aid.

Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs  through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its  central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as  Corazón de América ("Heart of America").The indigenous Guaraní had been  living in Paraguay for at least a millennium before the Spanish  conquered the territory in the 16th century. Spanish settlers and Jesuit  missions introduced Christianity and Spanish culture to the region.  Paraguay was on the periphery of Spain''s colonial empire, with few urban  centers and a sparse population. Following independence from Spain in  1811, Paraguay was ruled by a series of dictators who implemented  isolationist and protectionist policies.This development was truncated  by the disastrous Paraguayan War (1864–1870), in which the country lost  60 percent to 70 percent of its population through war and disease, and  about 140,000 square kilometers (54,054 sq mi) of territory to Argentina  and Brazil. Through the 20th century, Paraguay continued to endure a  succession of authoritarian governments, culminating in the regime of  Alfredo Stroessner, who led South America''s longest-lived military  dictatorship from 1954 to 1989. He was toppled in an internal military  coup, and free multi-party elections were organized and held for the  first time in 1993. A year later, Paraguay joined Argentina, Brazil and  Uruguay to found Mercosur, a regional economic collaborative.As of 2009,  Paraguay''s population was estimated to be at around 6.5 million, most  of whom are concentrated in the southeast region of the country. The  capital and largest city is Asunción, of which the metropolitan area is  home to nearly a third of Paraguay''s population. In contrast to most  Latin American nations, Paraguay''s indigenous language and culture,  Guaraní, remains highly influential. In each census, residents  predominantly identify as mestizo, reflecting years of intermarriage  among the different ethnic groups. Guaraní is recognized as an official  language alongside Spanish, and both languages are widely spoken in the  country, with around 92 percent of the general population speaking  Spanish and 98 percent speaking Guaraní.Paraguay has long been one of  the region''s most isolated countries, although since the turn of the  21st century, it has experienced rapid economic growth. In 2010, its  economy grew by 14.5 percent, the largest economic expansion in Latin  America, and the third-fastest in the world (after Qatar and Singapore).  By 2011, economic growth had slowed to 6.4 percent (still far higher  than the global average), but more than doubled to 13.6 percent in 2013,  one of the highest in South America and the world."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paraguay', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay', 'Guaraní paraguayo', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_language', 6758, '', '85', 2012, 'Paraguay (US /pɛərəɡwaɪ/, UK /pærəɡwaɪ/), officially the Republic of Paraguay (Spanish: República del Paraguay [reˈpuβlika ðel paɾaˈɣwaj], Guaraní: Tetã Paraguái [teˈtã paɾaˈɣwaj]), is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest.

A strait in the Persian Gulf  separates Qatar from the nearby island kingdom of Bahrain.Qatar is an  absolute monarchy that has been ruled by the Al Thani family since the  mid-19th century. Before the discovery of oil, Qatar was noted mainly  for sea trade and pearl hunting. It was a British protectorate until it  gained independence in 1971. In 1995, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani  became Emir when he deposed his father, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, in a  peaceful coup d''état, only to later step down in favor of his son,  Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, on June 2013. Qatar''s semi-elected Majlis al  Shura has very limited legislative authority to draft and approve laws;  the Emir has final say on all matters. Most Qataris belong to the strict  Wahhabi sect of Islam. Qatar has the most conservative society in the  Persian Gulf after Saudi Arabia.Qatar has the world''s third largest  natural gas reserves and oil reserves in excess of 25 billion barrels,  which have fueled Qatar to become the world''s richest country per capita  and achieve the highest human development in the Arab World and 36th  highest globally; furthermore, it is recognized as a high income economy  by the World Bank and also the 19th most peaceful country in the world.  Qatar is currently undergoing transformation under the National Vision  2030, in which it expects to achieve an advanced, sustainable, and  diversified economy. In order to promote tourism, Qatar has invested  billions into improving infrastructure. It held the 2006 Asian Games and  will be the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, becoming the first Arab  country to host either of the events. Qatar has become an influential  player in the Arab world. Qatar supported several rebel groups during  the Arab Spring both financially and by asserting global influence  through its expanding news group, Al Jazeera.Qatar''s support for the  Muslim Brotherhood and allied groups throughout the middle east, as well  as positions taken by Al Jazeera have led to increasing tensions with  other Gulf States. These came to a head during a March 2014 meeting of  the Gulf Cooperation Council, after which the UAE, Saudi Arabia and  Bahrain announced the recall of their ambassadors to Qatar.Qatar  maintains close relationships with western powers—Al Udeid Air Base  plays host to US and UK air forces—and eastern powers, and has often  tried to bridge the gap between Muslim and non-Muslim states. Qatar has a  population of around 1.8 million people; however, only 280,000 of these  are citizens, as the majority of the population are foreigners who work  and live in the state.

Its capital and largest city is Bucharest – the 6th largest city in the  EU.The United Principalities emerged when the territories of Moldavia  and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859. In  1866 Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was called to the throne as  the Ruling Prince of the Romanian Principate and in 1881 he was finally  crowned as King Carol I, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Romania.  Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on 9 May 1877, and was  internationally recognised the following year. At the end of World War  I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of  Romania.Following the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, the  Kingdom of Romania under King Carol II officially adopted a position of  neutrality. In summer 1940, a series of territorial disputes were  resolved unfavorably to Romania, resulting in the loss of most of the  territory gained in the wake of World War I. This caused the popularity  of Romania''s government to plummet. World War II gave cause to the rise  of a military dictatorship in Romania under far-right Marshal Ion  Antonescu, who chose to fight on the side of the Axis powers from  1941-44 in order to regain the provinces. After his removal, Romania  switched sides in 1944 and joined the Allies. By the end of the war,  some formerly Romanian northeastern territories were occupied by the  Soviet Union, with Red Army units stationed on Romanian soil. In 1947  Romania forcibly became a People''s Republic (1947–1965) and a member of  the Warsaw Pact. In 1965 Nicolae Ceaușescu became General Secretary of  the Romanian Workers'' Party, and the harsh austerity measures, political  repression, and cult of personality he implemented led to the Socialist  Republic of Romania (1965–1989) becoming the most Stalinist police  state in the Eastern bloc. Eventually his authoritarian government was  toppled in December 1989 during the Romanian Revolution.With the fall of  the Iron Curtain, Romania began its transition towards democracy and a  capitalist market economy. After a decade of post-revolution economic  problems and living-standards decline, extensive reforms fostered  economic recovery.

Extending across the entirety  of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans nine time  zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms.The  nation''s history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a  recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD.  Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants,  the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted  Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis  of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the  next millennium. Rus'' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller  states; most of the Rus'' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and  became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde. The Grand Duchy of  Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities,  achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the  cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus''. By the 18th century, the  nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and  exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest  empire in history, stretching from Poland in Europe to Alaska in North  America.Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative  Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the  Soviet Union, the world''s first constitutionally socialist state and a  recognized superpower, which played a decisive role in the Allied  victory in World War II. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant  technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world''s  first human-made satellite, and the first man in space. Following the  dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted  itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing  legal personality of the Union state.The Russian economy ranks as the  eighth largest by nominal GDP and fifth largest by purchasing power  parity.

Rwanda is in the  African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography  dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with  numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate of the country is  temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons  each year.The population is young and predominantly rural, with a  density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans form three groups: the  Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descend  from Rwanda''s earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of  and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe they are  derived from former social castes, while others view them as being races  or tribes. Christianity is the largest religion in the country, the  principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with French  and English as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of  government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared  with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report  suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on  freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict  administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five  provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda has the world''s  highest proportion of females in government positions in proportion to  the population.Hunter gatherers settled the territory in the stone and  iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced  first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated  from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others  militarily, centralising power, and later enacting anti-Hutu policies.  Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed  by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European  nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated pro-Tutsi policy. The  Hutu population revolted in 1959, massacring a large number of Tutsi and  ultimately establishing an independent Hutu-dominated state in 1962.  The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990,  which was followed by the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed  an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF  ended the genocide with a military victory.Rwanda''s economy suffered  heavily during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, but has since strengthened.  The economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea  are the major cash crops for export. Tourism is a fast-growing sector  and is now the country''s leading foreign exchange earner; Rwanda is one  of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely,  and visitors are prepared to pay high prices for gorilla tracking  permits.

Ibn Saud united the separate regions of Hejaz, Nejd,  Al-Hasa and Asir into a single state through a series of conquests  beginning in 1902 when he captured Riyadh, the ancestral home of his  family, the House of Saud (referred to in Arabic as Al Saud).

Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir  Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with  permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty  over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits  Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II,  Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 and  united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from  which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of  parliament. Since then, Singapore has developed rapidly, earning  recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.Singapore is one of the  world''s major commercial hubs, with the fourth-biggest financial centre  and one of the five busiest ports.

The territory has a mosaic  structure and an exceptionally high landscape and biological diversity,  which are a result of natural attributes and the long-term presence of  humans. Although the climate in the mainly hilly territory is influenced  by the continental climate, the Slovene Littoral has the  sub-Mediterranean climate, while the Alpine climate is found in the  north-western part of the country. The country is one of the most  water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system,  and significant karstic underground watercourses. Over half of the  territory is covered by forest. The settlement of Slovenia is dispersed  and uneven.The Slavic, Germanic, Romance, and Hungarian languages meet  here. Although the region is not homogenous, the predominant population  is Slovene. Slovene is the only official language throughout the  country, whereas Italian and Hungarian are regional minority languages.  Slovenia is a largely secularized country, but its culture and identity  have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as  Lutheranism. The economy of Slovenia is small, open, and export-oriented  and has been strongly influenced by international conditions. It has  been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis, started in late 2000s. The  main economic field is services, followed by industry and  construction.Historically, the current territory of Slovenia was part of  many different state formations, including the Roman Empire and the  Holy Roman Empire, followed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In October  1918, the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by  co-founding the internationally unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats  and Serbs, which merged that December with the Kingdom of Serbia into  the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia  in 1929). During World War II, Slovenia was occupied and annexed by  Germany, Italy, Croatia, and Hungary. Afterward, it was a founding  member of the Federal People''s Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In June 1991, after the  introduction of multi-party representative democracy, Slovenia split  from Yugoslavia and became an independent country.

Situated north of mainland Europe, it is about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. The group of islands range from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. The largest island is Spitsbergen, followed by Nordaustlandet and Edgeøya.Administratively, the archipelago is not part of any Norwegian county, but rather forms an unincorporated area administered by a state-appointed governor. Since 2002, Svalbard''s main settlement, Longyearbyen, has had an elected local government, somewhat similar to mainland municipalities. Other settlements include the Russian mining community of Barentsburg, the research station of Ny-Ålesund, and the mining outpost of Sveagruva. Svalbard is the northernmost place in the world with a permanent population.The islands were first taken into use as a whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the beginning of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, featuring among others the University Centre in Svalbard and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway.The archipelago features an Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas at the same latitude. The flora takes advantage of the long period of midnight sun to compensate for the polar night. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also features polar bears, reindeer, and marine mammals. Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of the archipelago, protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment.

In  the 7th century, Slavs inhabiting this territory played a significant  role in the creation of Samo''s Empire, historically the first Slavic  state which had its center in Western Slovakia. During the 9th century,  Slavic ancestors of the Slovaks established another political entity,  the Principality of Nitra, which later together with the Principality of  Moravia, formed Great Moravia. After the 10th century the territory of  today''s Slovakia was gradually integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary,  which itself became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire or Habsburg  Empire. After WWI and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,  the nation of Slovaks and Czechs established their mutual state -  Czechoslovakia. A separate Slovak state existed during World War II and  was a client state of Nazi Germany (from 1939 to 1944). In 1945  Czechoslovakia was reestablished.The present-day Slovakia became an  independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful dissolution of  Czechoslovakia.Slovakia is a high-income advanced economy with one of  the fastest growth rates in the European Union and the OECD.

Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic with a  directly elected president and a unicameral legislature. The country  has a tropical climate, with a diverse environment ranging from savannah  to rainforests. The country covers a total area of 71,740 km2 (27,699  sq mi) and with an estimated population of 6 million (2011 United  Nations estimate).Sierra Leone is divided into four administrative  regions: the Northern Province, Eastern Province, Southern Province and  the Western Area; which are subdivided into fourteen districts. Each  district has its own directly elected local government known as district  council, headed by a council chairman, in whom local executive  authority is vested. Freetown is Sierra Leone''s capital, its largest  city as well as its economic, commercial and political centre. Bo is  Sierra Leone''s second-largest city and second major economic centre.  Since Independence to present, Sierra Leone''s politics has been  dominated by two major political parties: the Sierra Leone People''s  Party (SLPP) and the All People''s Congress (APC).The population of  Sierra Leone is comprised of about sixteen ethnic groups, each with its  own language and custom. The two largest and most influential are the  Temne and the Mende. The Temne are predominantly found in the north of  the country, while the Mende are predominant in the south-east.Sierra  Leone is a predominantly Muslim country, though with an influential  Christian minority. Sierra Leone is regarded as one of the most  religiously tolerant countries in the world. Muslims and Christians  collaborate and interact with each other peacefully in the country.  Religious violence is very rare in Sierra Leone.Although English is the  language of instruction in schools and the official language in  government administration, the Krio language (derived from English and  several indigenous African languages) is the primary language of  communication among Sierra Leone''s different ethnic groups, and is  spoken by 90% of the country''s population. The Krio Language serves to  unite the different ethnic groups, especially in their trade and daily  interaction with each other.Sierra Leone has relied on mining,  especially diamonds, for its economic base. It is also among the largest  producers of titanium and bauxite, a major producer of gold, and has  one of the world''s largest deposits of rutile. Sierra Leone is home to  the third-largest natural harbour in the world. Despite exploitation of  this natural wealth, 70% of its people live in poverty.In 1462, the  Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra visited this area, naming it Serra  Leoa, meaning "Lioness Mountains", for the landscape around Freetown.  Posts in Sierra Leone were developed as centres of the Atlantic slave  trade, and hundreds of thousands of Africans were transported from the  interior to the Americas through trading posts in Sierra Leone. n the  late 18th century, the British Crown established a colony at Freetown,  for resettlements of freed slaves. About 1200 Black Loyalists were  resettled from Nova Scotia on 11 March 1792; they were mostly African  Americans from the former colonies, now the United States. Slaves  liberated from illegal trade in the early nineteenth century joined  them, and they developed the Krio people and language. In 1808, Freetown  became a British Crown colony. In 1896, Britain annexed the interior of  the country as a British protectorate, changing its relations with the  paramount chiefs.The united country achieved independence in 1961.  Competition among rival groups finally opened into the Sierra Leone  Civil War (1991 to 2002), which over more than a decade devastated the  country. It left more than 50,000 people dead, much of the country''s  infrastructure destroyed, and over two million people displaced as  refugees in neighbouring countries."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sierra_Leone', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language', 1344, '', '180', 2011, 'Sierra Leone (/sɪˈɛərə lɪˈoʊni, -lɪˈoʊn/), officially the Republic of Sierra Leone, is a country in West Africa that is bordered by Guinea to the northeast, Liberia to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest.

It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to  the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the  east, and Kenya to the southwest. Somalia has the longest coastline on  the continent''s mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus,  plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round,  with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.Somalia has a  population of around 10 million. About 85% of residents are ethnic  Somalis, who have historically inhabited the northern part of the  country. Ethnic minorities make up the remainder and are largely  concentrated in the southern regions. The official languages of Somalia  are Somali and Arabic, both of which belong to the Afro-Asiatic family.  Most people in the country are Muslim, with the majority being Sunni.In  antiquity, Somalia was an important commercial centre, and is among the  most probable locations of the fabled ancient Land of Punt. During the  Middle Ages, several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional  trade, including the Ajuran State, the Adal Sultanate, the Warsangali  Sultanate, and the Geledi Sultanate. In the late 19th century, through a  succession of treaties with these kingdoms, the British and Italians  gained control of parts of the coast and established the colonies of  British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. In the interior, Muhammad  Abdullah Hassan''s Dervish State successfully repelled the British Empire  four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region, The  Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 by British airpower. Italy  acquired full control of the northeastern and southern parts of the area  after successfully waging the so-called Campaign of the Sultanates  against the ruling Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo. Italian  occupation lasted until 1941, yielding to British military  administration. Northern Somalia would remain a protectorate, while  southern Somalia became a United Nations Trusteeship in 1949. In 1960,  the two regions united to form the independent Somali Republic under a  civilian government. Mohamed Siad Barre seized power in 1969 and  established the Somali Democratic Republic. In 1991, Barre''s government  collapsed as the Somali Civil War broke out.In the absence of a central  government, Somalia''s residents reverted to local forms of conflict  resolution. A few autonomous regions, including the Somaliland, Puntland  and Galmudug administrations, emerged in the north in the ensuing  process of decentralization. The early 2000s saw the creation of  fledgling interim federal administrations. The Transitional National  Government (TNG) was established in 2000, followed by the formation of  the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, which reestablished  national institutions such as the military. In 2006, the TFG, assisted  by Ethiopian troops, assumed control of most of the nation''s southern  conflict zones from the newly formed Islamic Courts Union (ICU). The ICU  subsequently splintered into more radical groups such as Al-Shabaab,  which battled the TFG and its AMISOM allies for control of the region,  with the insurgents losing most of the territory that they had seized by  mid-2012. In 2011–2012, a political process providing benchmarks for  the establishment of permanent democratic institutions was launched.  Within this administrative framework a new provisional constitution was  passed in August 2012 which reformed Somalia as a federation. Following  the end of the TFG''s interim mandate the same month, the Federal  Government of Somalia, the first permanent central government in the  country since the start of the civil war, was formed. The nation has  concurrently experienced a period of intense reconstruction,  particularly in the capital, Mogadishu.

The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which  together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between Thrace  and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey''s location at  the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant  geostrategic importance.Turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic  age, including various Ancient Anatolian civilizations and Thracian  peoples. After Alexander the Great''s conquest, the area was Hellenized,  which continued with the Roman rule and the transition into the  Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the  11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was greatly  accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of  Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the  Mongol invasion in 1243, upon which it disintegrated into several small  Turkish beyliks.Starting from the late 13th century, the Ottoman beylik  united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern  Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia  and Africa during the early modern period. After the Ottoman Empire  collapsed following its defeat in World War I, parts of it were occupied  by the victorious Allies. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues, resulted in the establishment  of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first  president.Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional  republic with a diverse cultural heritage.

The islands came  under Britain''s sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each  of the Ellice Islands was declared a British protectorate by Captain  Gibson R.N., of HMS Curacoa, between 9 and 16 October 1892.

Originally based in mainland China, the Republic of China now governs the island of Taiwan, which makes up over 99% of its territory, as well as Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other minor islands. Neighboring states include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to the east and northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taipei is the seat of the central government. New Taipei, encompassing the metropolitan area surrounding Taipei proper, is the most populous city.The island of Taiwan (formerly known as "Formosa") was mainly inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines until the Dutch and Spanish settlement during the Age of Discovery in the 17th century, when Han Chinese people began immigrating to the island. In 1662, the pro-Ming loyalist Koxinga expelled the Dutch and established the first Han Chinese polity to rule on the island, the Kingdom of Tungning. The Qing Dynasty of China later conquered Taiwan in 1683. By the time Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895, the majority of Taiwan''s inhabitants were Han Chinese either by ancestry or by assimilation. The Republic of China (ROC) was established in China in 1912. At the end of World War II in 1945, Japan surrendered Taiwan to ROC military forces on behalf of the Allies. Following the Chinese civil war, the Communist Party of China took full control of mainland China and founded the People''s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. The ROC relocated its government to Taiwan, and its jurisdiction became limited to Taiwan and its surrounding islands. In 1971, the PRC assumed China''s seat at the United Nations, which the ROC originally occupied. International recognition of the ROC has gradually eroded as most countries switched recognition to the PRC. Only 21 UN member states and the Holy See currently maintain formal diplomatic relations with the ROC, though it has informal ties with most other states via its representative offices.Constitutionally, the ROC government has claimed sovereignty over all of "China", in a definition that includes mainland China and Outer Mongolia, but has not made retaking mainland China a political goal since 1992. However, the government''s stance on defining its political position largely depends on which political coalition is in charge. Meanwhile, the PRC also asserts itself to be the sole legal representation of China and claims Taiwan as its 23rd province to be under its sovereignty, denying the status and existence of ROC as a sovereign state. The PRC has threatened the use of military force as a response to any formal declaration of Taiwanese independence, or if it deems peaceful reunification no longer possible. Cross-strait relations as well as issues of national identity within the country are important factors in Taiwanese politics and a cause of social and political division among political parties and their respective supporters.During the latter half of the 20th century, Taiwan experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization and is now an advanced industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Taiwan evolved into a multi-party democracy with universal suffrage. Taiwan is one of the Four Asian Tigers and a member of the WTO and APEC. The 19th-largest economy in the world, its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy. Taiwan is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, health care, public education, economic freedom, and human development.', 'http://dbpedia.org/page/Taiwan', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan', 'New Taiwan dollar', 'Chinese', 41581, '17', '23', 2012, 'Taiwan (/ˌtaɪˈwɑːn/ TY-WAHN Chinese: 臺灣 or 台灣; pinyin: Táiwān; see below), officially the Republic of China (ROC; Chinese: 中華民國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó), is a state in East Asia.

Following its fragmentation in the 13th  century, Ukraine was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of  powers. A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and  18th centuries, but Ukraine remained otherwise divided until its  consolidation into a Soviet republic in the 20th century, becoming an  independent state only in 1991.Ukraine has long been a global  breadbasket due to its extensive, fertile farmlands.

Ukrainian is the official language of Ukraine; its  alphabet is Cyrillic. Russian is also widely spoken. The dominant  religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has  strongly influenced Ukrainian architecture, literature and music.There  are different hypotheses as to the etymology of the name Ukraine.  According to an older and most widespread hypothesis, it means  "borderland", while more recently some linguistic studies claim a  different meaning: "homeland" or "region, country".

It is one of the world''s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.Paleo-indians migrated from Asia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The ensuing war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world''s largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country''s status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.The United States is a developed country and has the world''s largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and the world''s highest worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world''s sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world''s largest manufacturers.

The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums, and the sale of publications.The independent city-state was established in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty, signed by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri, on behalf of Pope Pius XI and by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

Venezuela''s territory covers around 916,445 square kilometres (353,841  sq mi) with an estimated population of approximately 29,100,000.  Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity, with  habitats ranging from the Andes mountains in the west to the Amazon  Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean  coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east.Venezuela  was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples.  In 1811 it became one of the first Spanish-American colonies to (declare  independence), which was not securely establish until 1821, when  Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of Gran Colombia. It  gained full independence as a separate country in 1830. During the 19th  century Venezuela suffered political turmoil and dictatorship, remaining  dominated by regional caudillos (military strongmen) until the mid-20th  century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic  governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several  political crises, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two  attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andrés  Pérez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in confidence  in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former career officer  Hugo Chávez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution, beginning with a  1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of  Venezuela.Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23  states, the Capital District (covering Caracas), and Federal  Dependencies (covering Venezuela''s offshore islands). Venezuela also  claims all Guyanese territory west of the Essequibo River, a 159,500  square kilometres (61,583 sq mi) tract dubbed Guayana Esequiba or the  Zona en Reclamación (the "zone being reclaimed").Venezuela is among the  most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of  Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital,  Caracas, which is also the largest city in Venezuela. Since the  discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of  the world''s leading exporters of oil and has the largest oil reserves.  Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such  as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government  revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a  long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996  and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell  to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.The recovery  of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated  social spending which significantly reduced inequality and poverty,  although the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis saw a renewed  economic downturn. By late 2010 Venezuela''s economy had some growth,  though this has been sluggish and accompanied by high inflation and  shortages. In February 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to the  rising shortages in the country. Shortages of items included toilet  paper, milk, flour and other necessities. As of November 2013,  Venezuela''s inflation has also greatly increased to 54%. According to  the 2013 Global Misery Index Scores, Venezuela was ranked as the top  spot globally with the highest misery index score."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venezuela', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spanish_language', 13634, '', '71.0', 2013, 'Venezuela (/ˌvɛnəˈzweɪlə/ VEN-ə-ZWAYL-ə, Spanish pronunciation: [be.neˈswela]), officially called the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Spanish: República Bolivariana de Venezuela [reˈpu.βlika βoliβaˈɾjana ðe βeneˈswela]), is a country on the northern coast of South America.

The country is bordered by China to the north, Laos  to the northwest, Cambodia to the southwest, and the South China Sea to  the east. Its capital city has been Hanoi since the reunification of  North and South Vietnam in 1976.The Vietnamese became independent from  Imperial China in AD 938, following the resounding Vietnamese victory in  the Battle of Bạch Đằng River. Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties  flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into  Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the  French in the mid-19th century. Following a Japanese occupation in the  1940s, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War,  eventually expelling the French in 1954. Thereafter, Vietnam was divided  politically into two rival states, North and South Vietnam. Conflict  between the two sides intensified, with heavy intervention from the  United States, in what is known as the Vietnam War. The war ended with a  North Vietnamese victory in 1975.Vietnam was then unified under a  Communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated.  In 1986, the government initiated a series of economic and political  reforms which began Vietnam''s path towards integration into the world  economy.

According to  the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency  International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In 2011,  series of street protests began in 15 January against poverty,  unemployment and corruption as well as against Saleh''s plan to amend  Yemen''s constitution and eliminate presidential term limit, in effect  making him president for life. He was also planning to have his son  Ahmed Saleh succeed him.The United States considers AQAP to be the "most  dangerous of all the franchises of Al-Qaeda". The U.S sought a  controlled transition that would enable their counter-terrorism  operations to continue. Saleh handed over power to his vice Abd Rabbuh  Mansur Hadi and was granted immunity from prosecution. A National  Dialogue Conference was launched on 18 March 2012 to reach consensus on  major issues facing the country''s future. The closing ceremony was held  on 25 January 2014. Yemen will become a multi-region federal republic.  President Hadi''s term was extended for another year in order to appoint  and monitor two committees. One to choose between two federal regions  (North and South) or six; and the other one to draft a new constitution.  The committees are expected to finish their assignments by January  2015."@en', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yemen', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen', '', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabic_language', 2249, '', '160', 2013, 'Yemen /ˈjɛmən/ (Arabic: اليَمَن‎ al-Yaman), officially known as the Republic of Yemen (Arabic: الجمهورية اليمنية‎ al-Jumhūriyyah al-Yamaniyyah), is an Arab country in Western Asia, occupying the southwestern to southern end of the Arabian Peninsula.

It has a  population of around 30 million inhabiting an area of approximately  652,000 km2 (252,000 sq mi), making it the 42nd most populous and 41st  largest nation in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and  the east, Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in  the north, and China in the far northeast.Afghanistan has been an  ancient focal point of the Silk Road and human migration. Archaeologists  have found evidence of human habitation from as far back as the Middle  Paleolithic. Urban civilization may have begun in the area as early as  3,000 to 2,000 BC. Sitting at an important geostrategic location that  connects the Middle East culture with Central Asia and the Indian  subcontinent, the land has been home to various peoples through the ages  and witnessed many military campaigns, notably by Alexander the Great,  Arab Muslims, Genghis Khan, and in modern-era Western forces. The land  also served as a source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids,  Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Mughals, Durranis and others have risen to form  major empires.The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan  begins in 1709 with the rise of the Pashtuns - historically known as  "Afghans" - when the Hotaki dynasty was established in Kandahar followed  by the rise of the Durrani Empire in 1747. In the late 19th century,  Afghanistan became a buffer state in the "Great Game" between British  India and the Russian Empire. Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War, King  Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was  stopped by ultra-conservatives. During the Cold War, after the  withdrawal of the British from neighboring India in 1947, the United  States and the Soviet Union began spreading influences in Afghanistan,  which led in 1979 to a bloody war between the US-backed mujahideen  forces and the Soviet-backed Afghan government in which over a million  Afghans lost their lives. This was followed by a 1990s civil war, the  rise and fall of the extremist Taliban government, and the 2001–present  war. In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council authorized  the creation of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to  help maintain security in Afghanistan and assist the Karzai  administration.Three decades of war made Afghanistan one of the world''s  most dangerous countries. While the international community is  rebuilding war-torn Afghanistan, terrorist groups such as the Haqqani  Network and Hezbi Islami are actively involved in a nationwide  Taliban-led insurgency, which includes hundreds of assassinations and  suicide attacks. According to the United Nations, the insurgents were  responsible for 80% of civilian casualties in 2011 and 2012. It suffers  from several challenges, including being world''s most corrupt country  and is the World''s largest source of refugees."@en'),

The declaration and fight for  independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that  lasted until 1861, which ended with the country''s reorganization as a  federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city. From then  on—while massive European immigration waves radically reshaped its  cultural and demographic outlook—Argentina enjoyed an historically  almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity: by the early 20th century it  already ranked as the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the  world.After 1930, however, and despite remaining among the fifteen  richest countries until mid-century, it descended into political  instability and suffered periodic economic crisis that sank it back into  underdevelopment.'),

The Kingdom of Armenia was established in the 6th century BC, after the  fall of Urartu; it became the first state in the world to adopt  Christianity as its official religion, in the early years of the 4th  century (the traditional date is 301 AD). For this reason, Armenia is  often referred to as the "first Christian nation." An Armenian  principality and later a kingdom, known as Cilician Armenia, existed on  the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th  centuries.By the 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland was  divided between the Ottoman and Russian empires. During World War I, the  Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were  systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. After almost 600  years of statelessness, Armenia was able to become independent in 1918;  however, the First Republic of Armenia was surrounded by hostile  countries that forcibly ended its independence in 1920.

It is bordered  by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north, Hungary and Slovakia to  the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and  Liechtenstein to the west. The territory of Austria covers 83,855 square  kilometres (32,377 sq mi) and has a temperate and alpine climate.  Austria''s terrain is highly mountainous due to the presence of the Alps;  only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640 ft), and its highest  point is 3,798 metres (12,461 ft). The majority of the population speak  local Bavarian dialects of German as their native language, and German  in its standard form is the country''s official language. Other local  official languages are Hungarian, Burgenland Croatian, and Slovene.The  origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg  dynasty when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy  Roman Empire. From the time of the Reformation, many Northern German  princes, resenting the authority of the Emperor, used Protestantism as a  flag of rebellion. The Thirty Years War, the influence of the Kingdom  of Sweden, and the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia, as well as the  Napoleonic invasions, all weakened the power of the Emperor in the North  of Germany, but in the South, and in non-German areas of the Empire,  the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control. During the 17th and 18th  centuries, Austria became one of the great powers of Europe and, in  response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French, the  Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804. Following Napoleon''s  defeat, Prussia emerged as Austria''s chief competitor for rule of a  larger Germany. Austria''s defeat by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz,  during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 cleared the way for Prussia to  assert control over the rest of Germany. In 1867, the empire was  reformed into Austria-Hungary. After the defeat of France in the 1870  Franco-Prussian War, Austria was left out of the formation of a new  German Empire, although in the following decades its politics, and its  foreign policy, increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led  Empire. During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of  Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the German Empire guided Austria in  issuing the ultimatum to Serbia that led to the declaration of the  First World War.After the collapse of the Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian)  Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I, Austria adopted and used the  name the Republic of German-Austria (Deutschösterreich, later  Österreich) in an attempt for union with Germany, but was forbidden due  to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The First Austrian  Republic was established in 1919. In the 1938 Anschluss, Austria was  occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany. This lasted until the end of World  War II in 1945, after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and  Austria''s former democratic constitution was restored. In 1955, the  Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state,  ending the occupation. In the same year, the Austrian Parliament created  the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian  Republic would become permanently neutral.Today, Austria is a  semi-presidential representative democracy comprising nine federal  states. The capital and largest city, with a population exceeding 1.7  million, is Vienna. Austria is one of the richest countries in the  world, with a nominal per capita GDP of $46,330 (2012 est.). The country  has developed a high standard of living and in 2011 was ranked 19th in  the world for its Human Development Index. Austria has been a member of  the United Nations since 1955, joined the European Union in 1995, and is  a founder of the OECD.

The borders of modern Bangladesh took shape during the  Partition of Bengal and British India in 1947, when the region became  the eastern wing of the newly formed state of Pakistan. Following years  of political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination, and  economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, a surge of  popular agitation, nationalism and civil disobedience led in 1971 to the  Bangladesh Liberation War, resulting in the separation of the region  from Pakistan and the formation of an independent Bangladesh.

It is bordered by Brazil to the north and  east, Paraguay and Argentina to the south, Chile to the southwest, and  Peru to the west.Prior to European colonization, the Andean region of  Bolivia was a part of the Inca Empire – the largest state in  Pre-Columbian America. The conquistadors took control of the region in  the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, this  territory was known as Upper Peru and was under the administration of  the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of Spain''s South American  colonies, although the area enjoyed substantial autonomy under the  jurisdiction of the Royal Court of Charcas. After the first call for  independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment  of the Republic, named for Simón Bolívar, on 6 August 1825. Bolivia has  struggled through periods of political instability and economic  woes.Bolivia is a democratic republic that is divided into nine  departments. Its geography is varied from the peaks of the Andes in the  West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the Amazon Basin. It is a  developing country, with a Medium Human Development Index score, and a  poverty level of 53%. Its main economic activities include agriculture,  forestry, fishing, mining, and manufacturing goods such as textiles,  clothing, refined metals, and refined petroleum. Bolivia is very wealthy  in minerals, especially tin.The Bolivian population, estimated at 10  million, is multiethnic, including Amerindians, Mestizos, Europeans,  Asians and Africans. The main language spoken is Spanish, although the  Guarani, Aymara and Quechua languages are also common, and all four, as  well as 34 other indigenous languages, are official. The large number of  different cultures within Bolivia has contributed greatly to a wide  diversity in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music."@en');

Its capital and largest city is Sarajevo. Bordered by Croatia to  the north, west and south, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro to the  southeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost landlocked, except for 20  kilometres (12 miles) of coastline on the Adriatic Sea surrounding the  city of Neum. In the central and eastern interior of the country the  geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and  the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically  larger region and has a moderate continental climate, bookended by hot  summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a  Mediterranean climate and plain topography.Bosnia and Herzegovina is a  region that traces permanent human settlement back to the Neolithic age,  during and after which it was populated by several Illyrian and Celtic  civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has  one of the richest histories in the region, having been first settled by  the Slavic peoples that populate the area today from the 6th through to  the 9th centuries CE. They then established the first independent  banate in the region, known as the Banate of Bosnia, in the early 12th  century upon the arrival and convergence of peoples that would  eventually come to call themselves Dobri Bošnjani ("Good Bosnians").  This evolved into the Kingdom of Bosnia in the 14th century, after which  it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire, under whose rule it would  remain from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The Ottomans  brought Islam to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social  outlook of the country. This was followed by annexation into the  Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which lasted up until World War I. In the  interwar period, Bosnia was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and  Slovenes and after World War II, the country was granted full republic  status in a newly formed Yugoslav Federation. Following the dissolution  of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the country proclaimed  independence in 1992, which was followed by the Bosnian War, lasting  until late 1995.Today, the country maintains high literacy, life  expectancy and education levels and is one of the most frequently  visited countries in the region, projected to have the third highest  tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020. Bosnia and  Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural  beauty and cultural heritage inherited from six historical  civilizations, its cuisine, winter sports, its eclectic and unique  music, architecture and its festivals, some of which are the largest and  most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is  home to three ethnic groups or, officially, constituent peoples, a term  unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosniaks are the largest group of the  three, with Serbs second and Croats third. Regardless of ethnicity, a  citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in English as a  Bosnian. The terms Herzegovinian and Bosnian are maintained as a  regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina  has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was  simply called "Bosnia" until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end  of the 19th century.Bosnia and Herzegovina has a bicameral legislature  and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic  group. However, the central government''s power is highly limited, as the  country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities:  the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, with a  third region, the Brčko District, governed under local government. The  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of  10 federal units - cantons. The country is a potential candidate for  membership to the European Union and has been a candidate for North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation membership since April 2010, when it  received a Membership Action Plan at a summit in Tallinn. Additionally,  the country has been a member of the Council of Europe since April 2002  and a founding member of the Mediterranean Union upon its establishment  in July 2008."@en'),

Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords Cambodia was governed briefly by a  United Nations mission (1992-1993).

Its total landmass is 181,035  square kilometres (69,898 sq mi), bordered by Thailand to the northwest,  Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to  the southwest.With a population of over 14.8 million, Cambodia is the  70th most populous country in the world. The official religion is  Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced by approximately 95% of the  Cambodian population. The country''s minority groups include Vietnamese,  Chinese, Chams, and 30 hill tribes. The capital and largest city is  Phnom Penh, the political, economic, and cultural center of Cambodia.  The kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with Norodom Sihamoni, a  monarch chosen by the Royal Throne Council, as head of state. The head  of government is Hun Sen, who is currently the longest serving non-royal  leader in South East Asia and has ruled Cambodia for over 25  years.Cambodia''s ancient name is "Kambuja" (Sanskrit: कंबुज). In 802 AD,  Jayavarman II declared himself king marking the beginning of the Khmer  Empire which flourished for over 600 years allowing successive kings to  dominate much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth.  The Indianized kingdom built monumental temples including Angkor Wat,  now a World Heritage Site, and facilitated the spread of first Hinduism,  then Buddhism to much of Southeast Asia. After the fall of Angkor to  Ayutthaya in the 15th century, Cambodia was then ruled as a vassal  between its neighbors.Cambodia became a protectorate of France in 1863,  Cambodia later gained independence in 1953.The Vietnam War extended into  Cambodia, during which the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh in 1975 and  later carried out the Cambodian Genocide from 1975-1979 when they were  ousted by Vietnam and then fought against the Vietnamese backed People''s  Republic of Kampuchea in the Cambodian–Vietnamese War (1979-1991).  Following the 1991 Paris Peace Accords Cambodia was governed briefly by a  United Nations mission (1992-1993). The UN withdrew after holding  elections in which around 90% of the registered voters cast ballots. The  1997 coup placed power solely in the hands of Prime Minister Hun Sen  and the Cambodian People''s Party who remain in power as of 2013.Since  the reestablishment of democracy, Cambodia still faces numerous  challenges and sociopolitical issues that stunt its development as a  nation. In 2013, Cambodia scored a 20 out of a scale of a 100 (highly  clean) to 0 (highly corrupt) on the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index,  which also ranked the nation as the a ranking of 160 out of 175 nations  (tied with other nations) making the nation one of the most corrupt in  the world and Cambodia is the 2nd most corrupt nation in Asia with North  Korea being the 1st. According to Freedom House in their 2013 report  Cambodia scored a 5.5 out of a scale of 1 (Free) to 7 (Not Free)  indicating that Cambodia as a nation is ''Not Free''. As of 2013, the  Human Development Index (HDI) ranks Cambodia 138th place (tied with  Laos) making the nation one of the lowest ranking in terms of human  development and that it indicates that Cambodia has lower medium to low  development presently. Cambodia is a low income economy with it having  one of the lowest annual incomes in the world with the agriculture  sector dominating the country''s economy, followed by the service and  industrial sectors. According to the Global Hunger Index, Cambodia  currently ranks as the 32nd hungriest nation in the world out of the  list of the 56 nations with the worst hunger situation(s) in the  world.Despite these challenges, Cambodia has since had one of the best  economic records in Asia, with economic growth averaging 6 percent for  the last 10 years.

Cameroon''s coastline lies on the  Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. The  country is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" for its geological  and cultural diversity. Natural features include beaches, deserts,  mountains, rainforests, and savannas. The highest point is Mount  Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaoundé  and Garoua. Cameroon is home to over 200 different linguistic groups.  The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly  makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team.  French and English are the official languages.Early inhabitants of the  territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka  hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. Portuguese explorers  reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area Rio dos  Camarões (Shrimp River), which became Cameroon in English. Fulani  soldiers founded the Adamawa Emirate in the north in the 19th century,  and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful  chiefdoms and fondoms. Cameroon became a German colony in 1884 known as  ''Kamerun".After World War I, the territory was divided between France  and Britain as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du  Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed  by France in the 1950s. It waged war on French and UPC militant forces  until 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became  independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo.  The southern part of British Cameroons merged with it in 1961 to form  the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country was renamed the United  Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in  1984.Compared with other African countries, Cameroon enjoys relatively  high political and social stability. This has permitted the development  of agriculture, roads, railways, and large petroleum and timber  industries. Nevertheless, large numbers of Cameroonians live in poverty  as subsistence farmers. Power lies firmly in the hands of the  authoritarian president since 1982, Paul Biya, and his Cameroon People''s  Democratic Movement party. The English-speaking territories of Cameroon  have grown increasingly alienated from the government, and politicians  from those regions have called for greater decentralization and even  secession (for example: the Southern Cameroons National Council) of the  former British-governed territories."@en'),

It is bordered by Chad in the north, Sudan in the  northeast, South Sudan in the east, the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and the Republic of the Congo in the south and Cameroon in the west.  The CAR covers a land area of about 620,000 square kilometres (240,000  sq mi) and has an estimated population of about 4.4 million as of 2008.  The capital is Bangui.France called the colony it carved out in this  region Oubangui-Chari, as most of the territory was located in the  Ubangi and Chari river basins. From 1910 until 1960, the colony was part  of French Equatorial Africa. It became a semi-autonomous territory of  the French Community in 1958 and then an independent nation on 13 August  1960, taking its present name. For over three decades after  independence, the CAR was ruled by presidents or an emperor, who either  were unelected or seized power. Local discontent with this system was  eventually reinforced by international pressure, following the end of  the Cold War.The first multi-party democratic elections in the CAR were  held in 1993, with the aid of resources provided by the country''s donors  and help from the United Nations. The elections brought Ange-Félix  Patassé to power, but he lost popular support during his presidency and  was overthrown in 2003 by General François Bozizé, who went on to win a  democratic election in May 2005. Bozizé''s inability to pay public sector  workers led to strikes in 2007, which led him to appoint a new  government on 22 January 2008, headed by Faustin-Archange Touadéra. In  February 2010, Bozizé signed a presidential decree which set 25 April  2010 as the date for the next presidential election. This was postponed,  but elections were held in January and March 2011, which were won by  Bozizé and his party. Despite maintaining a veneer of stability,  Bozizé''s rule was plagued by heavy corruption, underdevelopment,  nepotism, and authoritarianism, which led to an open rebellion against  his government. The rebellion was led by an alliance of armed opposition  factions known as the Séléka Coalition during the Central African  Republic Bush War (2004–2007) and the 2012–2013 Central African Republic  conflict. This eventually led to his deposition on 24 March 2013. As a  result of the coup d''etat and resulting chaos, governance in the CAR has  dissolved and Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye has said the country is  "anarchy, a non-state." Both the president and prime minister resigned  in January, 2014, to be replaced by an interim leader.Most of the CAR  consists of Sudano-Guinean savannas, but the country also includes a  Sahelo-Sudanian zone in the north and an equatorial forest zone in the  south. Two-thirds of the country lie in the basins of the Ubangi River,  which flows south into the Congo, while the remaining third lies in the  basin of the Chari, which flows north into Lake Chad.Despite its  significant mineral deposits and other resources, such as uranium  reserves in Bakouma, crude oil in Vakaga, gold, diamonds, lumber, and  hydropower, as well as significant quantities of arable land, the  Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world  and is among the ten poorest countries in Africa.

Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced  religions.Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved  into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st  millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad''s  Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade  routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by  1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa. In 1960,  Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye.  Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the  eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965. In 1978, the rebels  conquered the capital and put an end to the south''s hegemony. However,  the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré  defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss  Déby.

The relatively small central  area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is  the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late  19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions.  Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a  string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of  fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.Spain conquered  and settled Chile in the mid-16th century effectively replacing Inca  rule in northern and central Chile but failed to conquer the independent  Mapuche that inhabited south-central Chile. After declaring its  independence from Spain in 1818, Chile emerged in the 1830s as a  relatively stable authoritarian republic. In the 19th century, Chile  experienced significant economic and territorial growth ending Mapuche  resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in  the War of the Pacific (1879–83) after defeating Peru and Bolivia. In  the late 1960s and early 1970s, the country experienced severe  left-right political polarization and turmoil. This development  culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d''état that overthrew Salvador  Allende''s left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing  military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing.  The dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet ended in 1990 after it lost a  referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a centre-left coalition which  ruled through four presidencies until 2010.Today, Chile is one of South  America''s most stable and prosperous nations.

For millennia, China''s political system  was based on hereditary monarchies, known as dynasties, beginning with  the semi-mythological Xia of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since  221 BCE, when the Qin Dynasty first conquered several states to form a  Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed  numerous times. The Republic of China (ROC) overthrew the last dynasty  in 1911, and ruled the Chinese mainland until 1949. After the defeat of  the Empire of Japan in World War II, the Communist Party defeated the  nationalist Kuomintang in mainland China and established the People''s  Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang  relocated the ROC government to its present capital of Taipei.Since the  introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China has become one of the  world''s fastest-growing major economies.

Although speculated today by Arab  countries that the name Comoros originated from Arab people who arrived  in the islands much later, the name "Comoros" actually came from ancient  Polynesian, Melanesian and Australian people who settled among the  original African population B.C. "Comoros" was taken from the ancient  Polynesian word "Chammoras", one of their other settlements.[citation  needed] These inhabitants had their own distinct language "Comorian"  which was partly affected by the Arabs who arrived much later. The Union  of the Comoros has three official languages – Comorian, Arabic and  French – although French is the sole official language on  Mayotte.Officially, in addition to many smaller islands, the country  consists of the four major islands in the volcanic Comoros archipelago:  northwesternmost Grande Comore (Ngazidja); Mohéli (Mwali); Anjouan  (Nzwani); and southeasternmost Mayotte (Maore). Mayotte, however, has  never been administered by the Comoros government (or, before  independence, its predecessors). Instead, Mayotte continues to be  administered by France (currently as an overseas department) as it was  the only island in the archipelago that voted against independence in  1974. France has since vetoed United Nations Security Council  resolutions that would affirm Comorian sovereignty over the island. In  addition, a referendum on the question of Mayotte becoming an overseas  department of France in 2011 was held on 29 March 2009 and passed  overwhelmingly.The Comoros is the only state to be a member of the  African Union, Francophonie, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab  League (of which it is the southernmost state, being the only member of  the Arab League which is entirely within the Southern Hemisphere) and  the Indian Ocean Commission. Since independence in 1975, the country has  experienced numerous coups d''état and, as of 2008, about half the  population lives below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a  day."@en'),

Its capital and largest city is Zagreb.  The country is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb. Croatia  covers 56,594 square kilometres (21,851 square miles) and has diverse,  mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia''s Adriatic Sea  coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country''s population is  4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious  denomination being Roman Catholicism. The Croats arrived in the area of  present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They  organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. Tomislav became  the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom.  The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two  centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Peter Krešimir IV  and Dmitar Zvonimir. Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in  1102. In 1527, faced with Ottoman conquest, the Croatian Parliament  elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne. In  1918, after World War I, Croatia was included in the unrecognised State  of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs which seceded from Austria–Hungary and  merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A fascist Croatian puppet state  existed during World War II. After the war, Croatia became a founding  member and a federal constituent of Second Yugoslavia, a socialist  state. In June 1991, Croatia declared independence, which came into  effect on 8 October of the same year. The Croatian War of Independence  was fought successfully during the four years following the  declaration.Croatia today has a very high Human Development Index. The  International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and  developing economy, and the World Bank identified it as a high income  economy. Croatia is a member of the European Union, United Nations, the  Council of Europe, NATO, the World Trade Organization and a founding  member of the Union for the Mediterranean. As an active participant in  the UN peacekeeping forces, Croatia has contributed troops to the  NATO-led mission in Afghanistan and took a non-permanent seat on the UN  Security Council for the 2008–2009 term.The service sector dominates  Croatia''s economy, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture.  Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with  Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world.  The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government  expenditure. The European Union is Croatia''s most important trading  partner. Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in  infrastructure, especially transport routes and facilities along the  Pan-European corridors. Internal sources produce a significant portion  of energy in Croatia; the rest is imported.

To the north of Cuba lies the United States (150 km or  93 mi away) and the Bahamas are to the northeast, Mexico is to the west  (210 km or 130 mi away), the Cayman Islands and Jamaica are to the  south, and Haiti and the Dominican Republic are to the southeast.The  island of Cuba was inhabited by numerous Mesoamerican tribes prior to  the landing of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492, who  claimed it for the Kingdom of Spain. Cuba remained a colony of Spain  until the Spanish–American War of 1898, after which it was briefly  administered by the United States until gaining nominal independence in  1902. The fragile republic endured increasingly radical politics and  social strife, and despite efforts to strengthen its democratic system,  Cuba came under the dictatorship of former president Fulgencio Batista  in 1952. Growing unrest and instability led to Batista''s ousting in  January 1959 by the July 26 movement, which afterwards established a new  socialist administration under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since  1965, the country has been governed as a single-party state by the  Communist Party.Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, and with  over 11 million inhabitants, is the second-most populous after  Hispaniola, albeit with a much lower population density than most  nations in the region.

Cyprus is the third largest and third most  populous island in the Mediterranean, and a member state of the European  Union. It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon,  northwest of Israel, north of Egypt and east of Greece.The earliest  known human activity on the island dates to around the 10th millennium  BC. Archaeological remains from this period include the well-preserved  Neolithic village of Khirokitia, and Cyprus is home to some of the  oldest water wells in the world. Cyprus was settled by Mycenaean Greeks  in two waves in the 2nd millennium BC. At a strategic location in the  Middle East, it was subsequently occupied by several major powers,  including the empires of the Assyrians, Egyptians and Persians, from  whom the island was seized in 333 BC by Alexander the Great. Subsequent  rule by Ptolemaic Egypt, the Roman Empire, the Byzantines, Arab  caliphates for a short period, the French Lusignan dynasty and the  Venetians, was followed by over three centuries of Ottoman control.  Cyprus was placed under British administration in 1878 until it was  granted independence in 1960, becoming a member of the Commonwealth the  following year. In 1974, seven years after the intercommunal violence  between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, an attempted coup d''état by  Greek Cypriot nationalists and elements of the Greek military junta  with the aim of achieving enosis (union of the island with Greece) took  place. Turkey used this as a pretext to invade the northern portion of  the island. Turkish forces remained after a cease-fire, resulting in the  partition of the island; an objective of Turkey since 1955. The  intercommunal violence and subsequent Turkish invasion led to the  displacement of over 150,000 Greek Cypriots and 50,000 Turkish Cypriots,  and the establishment of a separate Turkish Cypriot political entity in  the north. These events and the resulting political situation are  matters of a continuing dispute.The Republic of Cyprus has de jure  sovereignty over the island of Cyprus and its surrounding waters,  according to international law, except for the British Overseas  Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, administered as Sovereign Base  Areas. However, the Republic of Cyprus is de facto partitioned into two  main parts; the area under the effective control of the Republic,  comprising about 59% of the island''s area, and the Turkish-controlled  area in the north, calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus and recognised only by Turkey, covering about 36% of the island''s  area. The international community considers the northern part of the  island as territory of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by Turkish  forces.Cyprus is a major tourist destination in the Mediterranean. An  advanced, high-income economy with a very high Human Development Index,  the Republic of Cyprus was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  until it joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.

The country is bordered by Germany to the west, Austria to the  south, Slovakia to the east and Poland to the north. Prague is the  capital and largest city, with 1.3 million residents. The Czech Republic  includes the historical territories of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as a  small part of Silesia.The Czech state, formerly known as Bohemia  (Čechy), was formed in the late 9th century as a small duchy around  Prague, at that time under the dominance of the powerful Great Moravian  Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power was  transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslids. In 1002,  Bohemia was formally recognized as a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire,  rising to the status of kingdom in 1212. During the rule of the  Přemyslids and their successors, the Luxembourgs, Bohemia expanded in  size until reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century.  During the Hussite wars, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and  crusades from all over Europe. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526,  the Kingdom of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg  monarchy as one of its three principal parts, alongside the Archduchy of  Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Bohemian Revolt (1618–20)  against Habsburg rule led to the Thirty Years'' War, after which the  monarchy consolidated its rule, re-imposed Catholicism, and enforced a  policy of Germanization. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire  in 1806, the Bohemian kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire. In the  19th century the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the  monarchy and the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was  formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire  after World War I. After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only  democracy in central and eastern Europe.Following the Munich Agreement  and the Polish annexation of Zaolzie, Czechoslovakia fell under German  occupation during World War II. By 1945, a major portion of the country  was liberated by the Red Army, and the subsequent gratitude towards the  Soviets, combined with disillusionment with the West for failing to  intervene, led the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia to victory in the  1946 elections. Following the 1948 coup d''état, Czechoslovakia became a  single-party communist state under Soviet influence. In 1968, increasing  dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known  as the Prague Spring, which ended with an invasion by the armies of the  Warsaw Pact countries (with the exception of Romania). Czechoslovakia  remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist  regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed. On 1  January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into its constituent  states: the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.In 2006, the Czech  Republic became first former member of the Comecon to achieve the status  of a developed country, according to the World Bank. The country has  the highest level of human development in Central and Eastern Europe,  ranking among the top 30 nations in the world. The Czech Republic ranks  as the ninth-most peaceful country in Europe, while achieving the best  performance in democratic governance and infant mortality in the region.

The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and  sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. The national  language, Danish, is closely related to and mutually intelligible with  Swedish and Norwegian.The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary constitutional  monarchy, with Margrethe II as queen regnant, organised as a  parliamentary democracy. The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5  June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. The  Constitution has been revised four times, most recently in 1953. The  seat of government is in the capital of Copenhagen. Denmark exercises  hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving political powers to  handle internal affairs. Denmark became a member of the European Union  in 1973, maintaining four opt-outs from European Union policies, as  outlined in the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement. Both the Faroe Islands and  Greenland remain outside the Union.The unified kingdom of Denmark  emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the  struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark was part of the Kalmar  Union, established in 1397, ended with Swedish secession in 1523. The  following year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway, which lasted  nearly three centuries until its dissolution in 1814. Beginning in the  17th century, there were several cessions of Danish territory; these  culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements, which  were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral  during World War I. In April 1940, Denmark was invaded by Germany with  brief, military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was  active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. Denmark joined  NATO in 1949, relinquishing its historically neutral stance. An  industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of  the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in  the early decades of the 20th century, making the basis for the present  welfare state with a highly developed mixed market economy.

Christopher Columbus landed on the island in  1492, and it became the site of the first permanent European settlement  in the Americas, namely Santo Domingo, the country''s capital and Spain''s  first capital in the New World. After three centuries of Spanish rule,  with French and Haitian interludes, the country became independent in  1821. The ruler, José Núñez de Cáceres, intended that the Dominican  Republic be part of the nation of Gran Colombia, but he was quickly  removed by the Haitian government and "Dominican" slave revolts.  Victorious in the Dominican War of Independence in 1844, Dominicans  experienced mostly internal strife over the next 72 years, and also a  brief return to Spanish rule. The United States occupation of 1916–1924,  and a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under Horacio  Vásquez Lajara, were followed by the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas  Trujillo Molina until 1961.

After independence, East Timor became a member of the  United Nations and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. It is  one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia, the  other being the Philippines.East Timor has a lower-middle-income  economy. About 37.4% of the country''s population lives below the  international poverty line – which means living on less than U.S. $1.25  per day – and about 50% of the population is illiterate. It continues to  suffer the aftereffects of a decades-long struggle for independence  against Indonesian occupation, which severely damaged the country''s  infrastructure and killed at least a hundred thousand people.

With over 93,000,000 inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most  populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most  populated nation on the African continent. It occupies a total area of  1,100,000 square kilometres (420,000 sq mi), and its capital and largest  city is Addis Ababa.Some of the oldest evidence for modern humans is  found in Ethiopia, which is widely considered the region from which Homo  sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. Tracing  its roots to the 2nd millennium BC, Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of  its history. Alongside Rome, Persia, China and India, the Kingdom of  Aksum was one of the great world powers of the 3rd century. In the 4th  century, it was the first major empire in the world to officially adopt  Christianity as a state religion.Ethiopia derived prestige for its  uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century  Scramble for Africa, and subsequently many African nations adopted the  colors of Ethiopia''s flag following their independence. Ethiopia was the  only African country to defeat a European colonial power and retain its  sovereignty as an independent country. It was the first independent  African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the UN. In  1974, at the end of Haile Selassie I''s reign, power fell to a communist  military junta known as the Derg, backed by the Soviet Union, until it  was defeated by the EPRDF, which has ruled since about the time of the  collapse of the USSR in 1991.Ethiopia is a multilingual society with  around 80 ethnic groups, with the two largest being the Oromo and the  Amhara. It is the origin of the coffee bean. Ethiopia is a land of  natural contrasts; with its vast fertile West, jungles, and numerous  rivers, the World''s hottest settlement in its north, Africa''s largest  continuous mountain ranges and the largest cave in Africa at Sof Omar.  Ethiopia has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. Ethiopia''s  ancient Ge''ez script, also known as Ethiopic, is one of the oldest  alphabets still in use in the world. The Ethiopian calendar, which is  seven years and about three months behind the Gregorian calendar,  co-exists alongside the Oromo calendar. The majority of the population  is Christian and a third is Muslim; the country is the site of the first  Hijra in Islamic history and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa at  Negash. A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews, known as Beta  Israel, resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s but most of them have since  gradually emigrated to Israel. Ethiopia is also the spiritual homeland  of the Rastafari movement, which globalized its flag colors worldwide  via pop culture and Reggae music.Ethiopia is one of the founding members  of the UN, the Group of 24 (G-24), the Non-Aligned Movement, G-77 and  the Organisation of African Unity, with Addis Ababa serving as the  headquarters of the African Union, the Pan African Chamber of Commerce  and Industry, the UNECA, the African Standby Force and much of global  NGOs focused on Africa.

This was followed by a civil war  where the pro-Bolshevik "Reds" were defeated by the pro-conservative  "Whites" with support from the German Empire. After a brief attempt to  establish a monarchy, Finland became a republic.

The country consists of 16 states  and its capital and largest city is Berlin. Germany covers an area of  357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi) and has a largely temperate  seasonal climate. With 80.6 million inhabitants, it is the most populous  member state in the European Union. Germany is the major economic and  political power of the European continent and a historic leader in many  cultural, theoretical and technical fields.Various Germanic tribes  occupied what is now northern Germany and southern Scandinavia since  classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented by the  Romans before AD 100. During the Migration Period that coincided with  the decline of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes expanded southward  and established kingdoms throughout much of Europe. Beginning in the  10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman  Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the  centre of the Protestant Reformation. Occupied during the Napoleonic  Wars, the rise of Pan-Germanism inside the German Confederation resulted  in the unification of most of the German states in 1871 into the German  Empire, which was dominated by Prussia.After the German Revolution of  1918–1919 and the subsequent military surrender in World War I, the  Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic in 1918, with  some of its territory partitioned in the Treaty of Versailles. Despite  its lead in many scientific and cultural fields at this time, Germany  nonetheless endured significant economic and political instability,  which intensified during the Great Depression and contributed to the  establishment of the Third Reich in 1933. The subsequent rise of fascism  led to World War II. After 1945, Germany was divided by allied  occupation, and evolved into two states, East Germany and West Germany.  In 1990, the country was reunified.Germany has the world''s  fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by  purchasing power parity. As a global leader in several industrial and  technological sectors, it is the second-largest exporter and  third-largest importer of goods. It is a developed country with a very  high standard of living, featuring comprehensive social security that  includes the world''s oldest universal health care system.

Much of the country was conquered by Spain which introduced its now  predominant language and many of its customs in the sixteenth century.  It became independent in 1821 and has been a republic since the end of  Spanish rule.The area of Honduras is about 112,492 km² and the  population exceeds eight million.

It is situated in the  Carpathian Basin and is bordered by Slovakia to the north, Ukraine and  Romania to the east, Serbia and Croatia to the south, Slovenia to the  southwest and Austria to the west. The country''s capital and largest  city is Budapest. Hungary is a member of the European Union, NATO, the  OECD, the Visegrád Group, and the Schengen Area. The official language  is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken non-Indo-European language  in Europe.Following centuries of successive habitation by Celts,  Romans, Huns, Slavs, Gepids, and Avars, the foundation of Hungary was  laid in the late 9th century by the Hungarian grand prince Árpád in the  Honfoglalás ("homeland-conquest"). His great-grandson Stephen I ascended  to the throne in 1000 AD, converting the country to a Christian  kingdom. By the 12th century, Hungary became a middle power within the  Western world. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Medieval Hungary  collapsed and succumbed to 150 years of partial Ottoman occupation  (1541–1699). Hungary eventually came under Habsburg rule, and later  formed a significant part of the Austro–Hungarian Empire  (1867–1918).Hungary''s current borders were first established by the  Treaty of Trianon (1920) after World War I, when the country lost 71% of  its territory, 58% of its population, and 32% of ethnic Hungarians.  Following the interwar period, Hungary joined the Axis Powers in World  War II, suffering significant damage and casualties. Hungary came under  the influence of the Soviet Union, which contributed to the  establishment of a four-decade long communist dictatorship (1947–1989).  The country gained widespread international attention regarding the  Revolution of 1956 and the seminal opening of its previously-restricted  border with Austria in 1989, which accelerated the collapse of the  Eastern Bloc.On 23 October 1989, Hungary again became a democratic  parliamentary republic, and is recognized today as a developed country.  Hungary is a popular tourist destination attracting 10.2 million  tourists a year (2011). It is home to the largest thermal water cave  system and the second largest thermal lake in the world (Lake Hévíz),  the largest lake in Central Europe (Lake Balaton), and the largest  natural grasslands in Europe (the Hortobágy)."@en'),
(88, 'Iceland', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iceland', '"Iceland /ˈaɪslənd/ (Icelandic: Ísland [ˈistlant]), sometimes  referred to in full as the Republic of Iceland (Lýðveldið Ísland), is a  Nordic island country marking the juncture between the North Atlantic  and the Arctic Ocean, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The country has a  population of 325,671 and a total area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi),  which makes it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The  capital and largest city is Reykjavík, with the surrounding areas in the  southwestern region of the country being home to two-thirds of the  country''s population. Reykjavík is the most northern capital in the  world. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior  consists mainly of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields,  mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea  through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a  temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic  Circle.According to Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in AD  874 when the chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent Norse  settler on the island. Others had visited the island earlier and stayed  over winter. During the following centuries, Norsemen settled Iceland,  bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. From 1262 to 1918, Iceland  was part of the Norwegian and later the Danish monarchies. The country  became independent in 1918 and a republic was declared in 1944.Until the  20th century, the Icelanders relied largely on fishing and agriculture,  and the country was one of the least developed in the region.  Industrialisation of the fisheries and aid through the United States''  Marshall Plan following World War II brought prosperity and, by the  1990s, Iceland had developed as one of the wealthiest and most developed  nations in the world. In 1994, Iceland became party to the European  Economic Area, which supported diversification of the economy into  economic and financial services. In 2008, affected by the worldwide  crisis, the nation''s entire banking system systemically failed,  resulting in substantial political unrest. In the wake of the crisis,  Iceland instituted "capital controls" that made it impossible for many  foreigners to get their money out of the country, causing a dispute with  foreign investors. The economy has since then made a significant  recovery.Iceland has a free-market economy with relatively low taxes  compared to other OECD countries. It maintains a Nordic social welfare  system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for  its citizens. Iceland ranks high in economic, political and social  stability and equality. In 2013, it was ranked as the 13th  most-developed country in the world by the United Nations'' Human  Development Index.Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation''s Norse  heritage. Most Icelanders are descendants of Norse and Gaelic settlers.  Icelandic, a North Germanic language, is descended from Old Norse and is  closely related to Faroese and some West Norwegian dialects. The  country''s cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine,  poetry, and the medieval Icelanders'' sagas. Among NATO members, Iceland  has the smallest population and is the only one with no standing army.  Its lightly armed Coast Guard is in charge of its defences."@en'),

It shares land borders with Lebanon in the north,  Syria in the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories  (or State of Palestine) comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip on the  east and southwest respectively, Egypt and the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red  Sea to the south, and it contains geographically diverse features within  its relatively small area. In its Basic Laws Israel defines itself as a  Jewish and Democratic State; it is the world''s only Jewish-majority  state.On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly  recommended the adoption and implementation of the partition plan of  Mandatory Palestine. On 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the Executive  Head of the World Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish  Agency for Palestine, declared "the establishment of a Jewish state in  Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel," a state independent  upon the termination of the British Mandate for Palestine, 15 May 1948.  Neighboring Arab armies invaded Palestine on the next day and fought the  Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring  Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai  Peninsula (between 1967 and 1982), part of South Lebanon (between 1982  and 2000), Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights. It annexed portions of  these territories, including East Jerusalem, but the border with the  West Bank is disputed. Israel has signed peace treaties with Egypt and  Jordan, but efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have so  far not resulted in peace.Israel''s financial center is Tel Aviv, while  Jerusalem is the country''s most populous city and its designated  capital, though internationally Jerusalem is not considered to be a part  of Israel.Ethnic groups in Israel include Mizrahi Jews, Ashkenazi Jews,  Palestinians, Sephardi Jews, Yemenite Jews, Ethiopian Jews, Bedouin,  Druze, and many other groups.

(98, 'Italy', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy', '"Italy /ˈɪtəli/ (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja]), officially the  Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica italiana), is a unitary  parliamentary republic in Southern Europe. To the north, Italy borders  France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, and is approximately  delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the  Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian  Peninsula and the two biggest Mediterranean islands of Sicily and  Sardinia.Italian territory also includes the islands of Pantelleria, 60  km (37 mi) east of the Tunisian coast and 100 km (62 mi) southwest of  Sicily, and Lampedusa, at about 113 km (70 mi) from Tunisia and at 176  km (109 mi) from Sicily, in addition to many other smaller islands. The  sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within  Italy, while Campione d''Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.  Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely  temperate climate. With 60 million inhabitants, it is the 5th most  populous country in Europe. Italy is also the 4th-largest economy in the  European Union, 3rd in the Eurozone and 9th in the world (IMF,  2012).Italy''s capital and largest city, Rome, has for centuries been the  leading political and religious centre of Western civilisation, serving  as the capital of both the Roman Empire and Christianity. During the  Dark Ages, Italy endured cultural and social decline in the face of  repeated invasions by Germanic tribes, with Roman heritage being  preserved largely by Christian monks. Beginning around the 11th century,  various Italian cities, communes and maritime republics rose to great  prosperity through shipping, commerce and banking (indeed, modern  capitalism has its roots in Medieval Italy); concurrently, Italian  culture flourished, especially during the Renaissance, which produced  many notable scholars, artists, and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci,  Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli. Meanwhile, Italian explorers  such as Polo, Columbus, Vespucci, and Verrazzano discovered new routes  to the Far East and the New World, helping to usher in the European Age  of Discovery. Nevertheless, Italy would remain fragmented into numerous  warring states for the rest of the Middle Ages, subsequently falling  prey to larger European powers such as France, Spain, and later Austria.  Italy would thus enter a long period of decline that lasted until the  beginning of the 18th century.After many unsuccessful attempts, the  second and the third wars of Italian independence resulted in the  unification of most of present-day Italy between 1859 and 1866. From the  late 19th century to the early 20th century, the new Kingdom of Italy  rapidly industrialized and acquired a colonial empire becoming a Great  Power. However, Southern and rural Italy remained largely excluded from  industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora. Despite  victory in World War I as one of the Big Four with permanent membership  in the security council of the League of Nations, Italy entered a period  of economic crisis and social turmoil, which favoured the establishment  of a Fascist dictatorship in 1922. The subsequent participation in  World War II, at the side of Nazi Germany and Japan forming the Axis  Alliance, ended in military defeat, economic destruction and civil war.  In the years that followed, Italy abolished the monarchy, reinstated  democracy, and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, thus becoming one of  the most developed nations in the world, with the fifth largest economy  by nominal GDP by the early 1990s. Italy was a founding member of NATO  in 1949 and one of the Inner Six of the European Community in 1957,  which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and has  been a member of the Eurozone since 1999.Italy is considered to be both a  major regional power and a leading middle power, with membership in  prominent institutions such as the UN, the EU, the NATO, the OECD, the  OSCE, the DAC, the WTO, the G6, G7, G8, G10, G20, the Union for the  Mediterranean, the Latin Union, the Council of Europe, the Central  European Initiative and the Uniting for Consensus. Italy currently  maintains the world''s tenth-largest nominal defence budget and is a  participant in the NATO nuclear sharing policy."@en'),

Kazakhstan is the world''s largest landlocked  country by land area and the ninth largest country in the world; its  territory of 2,727,300 square kilometres (1,053,000 sq mi) is larger  than Western Europe. It has borders with (clockwise from the north)  Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and also  adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea. The terrain of Kazakhstan  includes flatlands, steppe, taiga, rock canyons, hills, deltas,  snow-capped mountains, and deserts. With 17 million people (2013  estimate) Kazakhstan has the 62nd largest population in the world,  though its population density is less than 6 people per square kilometre  (15 people per sq. mi.). The capital is Astana, where it was moved from  Almaty in 1997.The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been  inhabited by nomadic tribes. This changed in the 13th century, when  Genghis Khan occupied the country. When his ruling family fought for  power, power generally switched back to the nomads. By the 16th century,  the Kazakhs emerged as a distinct group, divided into three jüz  (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The Russians began  advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century, and by the  mid-19th century all of Kazakhstan was part of the Russian Empire.  Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, and subsequent civil war, the  territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times before becoming  the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936, a part of the Soviet  Union.Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare  independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991; the  current President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been leader of the country  since 1991.

It is  bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south.  Lebanon''s location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the  Arabian hinterland has dictated its rich history and shaped a cultural  identity of religious and ethnic diversity.The earliest evidence of  civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years,  predating recorded history. Lebanon was the home of the Phoenicians, a  maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years (c. 1550–539  BC). In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire, and  eventually became one of the Empire''s leading centers of Christianity.  In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite  Church was established. As the Arab Muslims conquered the region, the  Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new  religious group, the Druze, established themselves in Mount Lebanon as  well, a religious divide that would last for centuries. During the  Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic  Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established  with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era.The  region eventually came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, a political  empire that which came to power from 1299-1923. Following the collapse  of the Empire after World War I, the five provinces that constitute  modern Lebanon were mandated to France. The French expanded the borders  of Mount Lebanon, which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze, to  include more Muslims. Lebanon gained independence in 1943, establishing a  unique political system – "confessionalism" – that is a power-sharing  mechanism based on religious communities. Bechara El Khoury (independent  Lebanon''s first president), Riad El-Solh (Lebanon''s first prime  minister) and Emir Majid Arslan (Lebanon''s first minister of defence)  are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are  national heroes for having led the country''s independence. French troops  withdrew from Lebanon in 1946.Before the Lebanese Civil War  (1975–1990), the country experienced a period of relative calm and  renowned prosperity, driven by tourism, agriculture, commerce, and  banking. Because of its financial power and diversity, Lebanon was known  in its heyday as "the Switzerland of the East". It attracted so many  tourists that the capital, Beirut, was referred to as "the Paris of the  Middle East". At the end of the war, there were extensive efforts to  revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure."@en'),

English is the official language and over thirty indigenous languages  are also spoken within the country. Its coastline is composed mostly of  mangroves, while its more sparsely populated inland consists of forests  opening onto a plateau of drier grasslands. The climate is hot and  equatorial, with significant rainfall during the May–October rainy  season and harsh harmattan winds the remainder of the year. The country  possesses about forty percent of the remaining Upper Guinean  rainforest.Liberia is the only country in Africa founded by United  States colonization while occupied by native Africans. Beginning in  1820, the region was colonized by African Americans, most of whom were  freed slaves. The colonizers (who later become known as  Americo-Liberians) established a new country with the help of the  American Colonization Society, a private organization whose leaders  thought former slaves would have greater opportunity in Africa. African  captives freed from slave ships by the British and Americans were sent  there instead of being repatriated to their countries of origin. In  1847, this new country became the Republic of Liberia, establishing a  government modeled on that of the United States and naming its capital  city Monrovia after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United  States and a prominent supporter of the colonization. The colonists and  their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, led the political,  social, cultural and economic sectors of the country and ruled the  nation for over 130 years as a dominant minority.The country began to  modernize in the 1940s following investment by the United States during  World War II and economic liberalization under President William Tubman.  Liberia was a founding member of the United Nations and the  Organisation of African Unity. In 1980 a military coup overthrew the  Americo-Liberian leadership, marking the beginning of political and  economic instability and two successive civil wars. These resulted in  the deaths of between 250,000 and 520,000 people and devastated the  country''s economy. A peace agreement in 2003 led to democratic elections  in 2005. Today, Liberia is recovering from the lingering effects of the  civil wars and their consequent economic upheaval, but about 85% of the  population continue to live below the international poverty line."@en'),

Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi''s  largest city; the second largest is Blantyre and the third is Mzuzu. The  name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people  that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed "The Warm Heart of  Africa".The area of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating  Bantu groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area  was colonized by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as Nyasaland,  became part of the semi-independent central African Federation (CAF).  The Federation was dissolved in 1963 and in 1964, Nyasaland gained full  independence and was renamed Malawi. Upon gaining independence it became  a single-party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda, who  remained president until 1994, when he was ousted from power. Joyce  Banda (no relation) is the current president, raised to that position  after president Bingu wa Mutharika died in 2012. She is the first female  president in Malawi. (see also Rose Chibambo for examples of women  political leaders in Malawi). Malawi has a democratic, multi-party  government. Malawi has a small military force that includes an army, a  navy and an air wing. Malawi''s foreign policy is pro-Western and  includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and  participation in several international organisations.Malawi is among the  world''s least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in  agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian government  depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this  need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian  government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy,  improving education, health care, environmental protection, and becoming  financially independent.

There is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which is a  drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a  diverse population of native peoples, Asians and Europeans, with several  languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs.

Its size is just  over 1,240,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) with a population of  14.5 million. Its capital is Bamako.Mali consists of eight regions and  its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara, while  the country''s southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live,  features the Niger and Senegal rivers. The country''s economic structure  centers on agriculture and fishing. Some of Mali''s prominent natural  resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the  African continent, and salt. About half the population lives below the  international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.Present-day Mali was once  part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade:  the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire (for which Mali is named), and the  Songhai Empire. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of  mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, Mali  covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France, and stretched  to the west coast of Africa. In the late 19th century, during the  Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of  French Sudan. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined  with Senegal in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali  Federation. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal''s withdrawal from the  federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent  Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a 1991 coup led  to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a  democratic, multi-party state.In January 2012, an armed conflict broke  out in northern Mali, which Tuareg rebels took control of by April and  declared the secession of a new state, Azawad. The conflict was  complicated by a military coup that took place in March and later  fighting between Tuareg and Islamist rebels. In response to Islamist  territorial gains, the French military launched Opération Serval in  January 2013. A month later, Malian and French forces recaptured most of  the north. Presidential elections were held on 28 July 2013, with a  second round run-off held on 11 August, and legislative elections were  held on 24 November 2013."@en'),

The islands share maritime  boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west, Wake  Island to the north, Kiribati to the south-east, and Nauru to the south.  The most populous atoll is Majuro, which also acts as the  capital.Micronesian colonists gradually settled the Marshall Islands  during the 2nd millennium BC, with inter-island navigation made possible  using traditional stick charts. Islands in the archipelago were first  explored by Europeans in the 1520s, with Spanish explorer Alonso de  Salazar sighting an atoll in August 1526. Other expeditions by Spanish  and English ships followed, with the islands'' current name stemming from  British explorer John Marshall. Recognised as part of the Spanish East  Indies in 1874, the islands were sold to Germany in 1884, and became  part of German New Guinea in 1885. The Empire of Japan occupied the  Marshall Islands in World War I, which were later joined with other  former German territories in 1919 by the League of Nations to form the  South Pacific Mandate. In World War II, the islands were conquered by  the United States in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Along  with other Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands were then consolidated  into the United-States-governed Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.  Self-government was achieved in 1979, and full sovereignty in 1986,  under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.Politically,  the Marshall Islands is a presidential republic in free association with  the United States, with the US providing defense, funding grants, and  access to social services. Having few natural resources, the islands''  wealth is based on a service economy, as well as some fishing and  agriculture, with a large percentage of the islands'' gross domestic  product coming from United States aid.

In 1521, the Spanish Empire conquered and colonized the  territory from its base in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, which was administered  as the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This territory would eventually become  Mexico following recognition of the colony''s independence in 1821. The  post-independence period was characterized by economic instability, the  Mexican-American War that led to the territorial cession to the United  States, the Pastry War, the Franco-Mexican War, a civil war, two empires  and a domestic dictatorship. The latter led to the Mexican Revolution  in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the 1917 Constitution  and the emergence of the country''s current political system.

A historically  prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not  shared by its neighbours. Its distinct culture is a blend of Arab,  indigenous Berber, African, and European influences.Morocco claims the  non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its Southern  Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla  war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes  have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.Morocco is a  constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco  holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the  military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is  exercised by the government, while Legislative power is vested in both  the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of  Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue  decrees called dahirs which have the force of law. He can also dissolve  the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister and the president of  the Constitutional court.Morocco''s predominant religion is Islam, while  the official languages are Berber and Arabic.

It is separated from  Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and  largest city is Maputo (previously called Lourenço Marques before  independence).Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, Bantu-speaking  peoples migrated from farther north and west. Swahili, and later also  Arab, commercial ports existed along the coasts until the arrival of  Europeans. The area was explored by Vasco da Gama in 1498 and colonized  by Portugal from 1505. After over four centuries of Portuguese rule,  Mozambique gained independence in 1975, becoming the People''s Republic  of Mozambique shortly thereafter. After only two years of independence,  the country descended into an intense and protracted civil war lasting  from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first multiparty  elections and has remained a relatively stable presidential republic  since.Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources.

Most  of the territory became a German Imperial protectorate in 1884 and  remained a German colony until the end of World War I. In 1920, the  League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed  its laws and, from 1948, its apartheid policy.

It recognised the South West Africa People''s Organisation  (SWAPO) as the official representative of the Namibian people in 1973.  Namibia, however, remained under South African administration during  this time as South-West Africa.

The country''s physical  geography divides it into three major zones: Pacific lowlands; wet,  cooler central highlands; and the Caribbean lowlands. On the Pacific  side of the country are the two largest fresh water lakes in Central  America—Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua. Surrounding these lakes and  extending to their northwest along the rift valley of the Gulf of  Fonseca are fertile lowland plains, with soil highly enriched by ash  from nearby volcanoes of the central highlands. Nicaragua''s abundance of  biologically significant and unique ecosystems contribute to  Mesoamerica''s designation as a biodiversity hotspot.The Spanish Empire  conquered the region in the 16th century. Nicaragua achieved its  independence from Spain in 1821. Since its independence, Nicaragua has  undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, and fiscal  crisis—the most notable causes that led to the Nicaraguan Revolution of  the 1960s and 1970s. Nicaragua is a representative democratic republic,  and has experienced economic growth and political stability in recent  years. Since 2007, Daniel Ortega has been the President.The population  of Nicaragua, approximately 6 million, is multiethnic. Its capital,  Managua, is the third-largest city in Central America. Segments of the  population include indigenous native tribes from the Mosquito Coast,  Europeans, Africans, Asians, and people of Middle Eastern origin. The  main language is Spanish, although native tribes on the eastern coast  speak their native languages, such as Miskito, Sumo, and Rama, as well  as English Creole. The mixture of cultural traditions has generated  substantial diversity in art and literature, particularly the latter  given the various literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and  writers, including Rubén Darío, Pablo Antonio Cuadra and Ernesto  Cardenal. The biological diversity, warm tropical climate, and active  volcanoes make Nicaragua an increasingly popular tourist  destination."@en'),

Niger covers a land area of almost  1,270,000 km2, making it the largest nation in West Africa, with over 80  percent of its land area covered by the Sahara desert. The country''s  predominantly Islamic population of 17,138,707 is mostly clustered in  the far south and west of the nation. The capital city is Niamey,  located in the far-southwest corner of Niger.Niger is a developing  country, and is consistently one of the lowest-ranked in the United  Nations'' Human Development Index (HDI); it was ranked 186th of 186  countries for 2012. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are  threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is  concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in  the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials, especially  uranium ore. Niger faces serious challenges to development due to its  landlocked position, desert terrain, poor education and poverty of its  people, lack of infrastructure, poor health care, and environmental  degradation.Nigerien (/niːˈʒɛəriən/) society reflects a diversity drawn  from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and  regions and their relatively short period living in a single state.  Historically, what is now Niger has been on the fringes of several large  states. Since independence, Nigeriens have lived under five  constitutions and three periods of military rule. Following a military  coup in 2010, Niger has become a democratic, multi-party state. A  majority live in rural areas, and have little access to advanced  education."@en'),

Its coast in the  south lies on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean.Long the site of  numerous kingdoms and empires, the modern state of Nigeria has its  origins in the British colonization of the region during the late  nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, emerging from the combination  of two neighboring British protectorates: (the Southern Nigeria  Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate). The British set up  administrative and legal structures while retaining traditional  chiefdoms. Nigeria became independent in 1960, but plunged into civil  war several years later. It has since alternated between  democratically-elected civilian governments and military dictatorships,  with its 2011 presidential elections being viewed as the first to be  conducted reasonably free and fair.Nigeria is often referred to as the  "the Giant of Africa", due to its large population and economy. With  around 174 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in  Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. The country  is inhabited by over 500 ethnic groups, of which the three largest are  the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba.Nigeria is roughly divided in half between  Christians, who mostly live in the Southern and central parts of the  country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the North and South-West.

The name Korea is derived from  Goryeo, a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. The capital and  largest city is Pyongyang. North Korea shares a land border with China  to the north and north-west, along the Amnok (Yalu) and Tumen rivers. A  small section of the Tumen River also forms North Korea''s short border  with Russia to the northeast. The Korean Demilitarized Zone marks the  boundary between North Korea and South Korea. The legitimacy of this  border is not accepted by either side, as both states claim to be the  legitimate government of the entire peninsula.The Korean Peninsula was  governed by the Korean Empire from the late 19th century to the early  20th century, until it was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. After  the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, Japanese rule  ceased. The Korean Peninsula was divided into two occupied zones in  1945, with the northern part of the peninsula occupied by the Soviet  Union and the southern portion by the United States. A United  Nations-supervised election held in 1948 led to the creation of separate  Korean governments for the two occupation zones: the Democratic  People''s Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in  the south. The conflicting claims of sovereignty led to the Korean War  in 1950. An armistice in 1953 committed both to a cease-fire, but the  two countries remain officially at war because a formal peace treaty was  never signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in  1991.Although the DPRK officially describes itself as a Juche  Korean-style socialist republic and elections are held, it is widely  considered a dictatorship that has been described as totalitarian and  Stalinist with an elaborate cult of personality around the Kim family.  The Workers'' Party of Korea, led by a member of the ruling family, holds  de facto power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are  required to be a member. Juche, an ideology of self-reliance initiated  by the country''s first President, Kim Il-sung, became the official state  ideology, replacing Marxism–Leninism, when the country adopted a new  constitution in 1972. In 2009, references to Communism (Chosŏn''gŭl:  공산주의) were removed from the country''s constitution.The means of  production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and  collectivized farms, and most services such as healthcare, education,  housing and food production are state funded or subsidized. In the 1990s  North Korea suffered from a famine and continues to struggle with food  production. In 2013, the UN identified North Korean government policies  as the primary cause of the shortages and estimated that 16 million  people required food aid. North Korea''s health care system has been a  subject of controversy: the World Health Organization described it as  "the envy of the developing world" while Amnesty International claims  that it suffers from barely functioning hospitals, poor hygiene and  epidemics.North Korea follows Songun, or "military-first" policy in  order to strengthen the country and its government. It is the world''s  most militarized society, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and  paramilitary personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the 4th  largest in the world, after China, the U.S., and India. It is a  nuclear-weapons state and has an active space program. As a result of  its isolation, it is sometimes known as the "hermit kingdom". The  Economist Intelligence Unit ranked it as the lowest country in the  Democracy Index. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN''s  commission on human rights in North Korea report of severe restrictions  on human rights and crimes against humanity ''without parallel in the  modern world''.

The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden  (1,619 km or 1,006 mi long), which is the longest uninterrupted border  within both Scandinavia & Europe at large. Norway is bordered by  Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak Strait to the  south, with Denmark on the other side. It shares maritime borders with  Russia by the Barents Sea; Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland by  the Norwegian Sea; and Sweden, Denmark, and the United Kingdom by the  North Sea. Norway''s extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean  and the Barents Sea, is laced with fjords, a renowned part of its  landscape. The capital city Oslo is the largest in the nation, with a  population of 630,000. Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum,  natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, fresh water, and hydropower.Two  centuries of Viking raids to southern and western areas tapered off  following the adoption of Christianity in AD 994. Norway expanded its  control overseas to parts of Britain, Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland.  Norwegian power peaked in 1265, but competition from the Hanseatic  League and the spread of the Black Death weakened the country. In 1380,  Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four  centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to  Sweden and adopted a constitution. Sweden went to war with Norway but  agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the  union under a Swedish king. Later Norway demanded independence, which it  gained in a referendum in 1905. Norway remained neutral in World War I.  Despite its declaration of neutrality in World War II, Norway was  occupied for 5 years by forces of Nazi Germany. In 1949 it abandoned  neutrality, becoming a founding member of NATO. Discovery of oil in  adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway''s economic fortunes.  The country maintains a welfare model with universal health care,  subsidised higher education, and a comprehensive social security system.  Key domestic issues include maintaining the country''s extensive social  safety net with an aging population and preserving economic  competitiveness. The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of  the country''s gross domestic product.King Harald V is Norway''s head of  state and Erna Solberg became Prime Minister on 16 October 2013,  replacing Jens Stoltenberg, and the government made a shift from being a  labour to a conservative government. It has administrative subdivisions  on two levels, known as counties (fylke) and municipalities (kommuner).  The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and  influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and  the Finnmark Act. Norway maintains close ties with the European Union  and its member countries (despite rejecting full EU membership in two  referenda), as well as with the United States. Norway participates with  United Nations forces in international missions, notably in Afghanistan,  Kosovo, Sudan, and Libya.

Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs  through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its  central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as  Corazón de América ("Heart of America").The indigenous Guaraní had been  living in Paraguay for at least a millennium before the Spanish  conquered the territory in the 16th century. Spanish settlers and Jesuit  missions introduced Christianity and Spanish culture to the region.  Paraguay was on the periphery of Spain''s colonial empire, with few urban  centers and a sparse population. Following independence from Spain in  1811, Paraguay was ruled by a series of dictators who implemented  isolationist and protectionist policies.This development was truncated  by the disastrous Paraguayan War (1864–1870), in which the country lost  60 percent to 70 percent of its population through war and disease, and  about 140,000 square kilometers (54,054 sq mi) of territory to Argentina  and Brazil. Through the 20th century, Paraguay continued to endure a  succession of authoritarian governments, culminating in the regime of  Alfredo Stroessner, who led South America''s longest-lived military  dictatorship from 1954 to 1989. He was toppled in an internal military  coup, and free multi-party elections were organized and held for the  first time in 1993. A year later, Paraguay joined Argentina, Brazil and  Uruguay to found Mercosur, a regional economic collaborative.As of 2009,  Paraguay''s population was estimated to be at around 6.5 million, most  of whom are concentrated in the southeast region of the country. The  capital and largest city is Asunción, of which the metropolitan area is  home to nearly a third of Paraguay''s population. In contrast to most  Latin American nations, Paraguay''s indigenous language and culture,  Guaraní, remains highly influential. In each census, residents  predominantly identify as mestizo, reflecting years of intermarriage  among the different ethnic groups. Guaraní is recognized as an official  language alongside Spanish, and both languages are widely spoken in the  country, with around 92 percent of the general population speaking  Spanish and 98 percent speaking Guaraní.Paraguay has long been one of  the region''s most isolated countries, although since the turn of the  21st century, it has experienced rapid economic growth. In 2010, its  economy grew by 14.5 percent, the largest economic expansion in Latin  America, and the third-fastest in the world (after Qatar and Singapore).  By 2011, economic growth had slowed to 6.4 percent (still far higher  than the global average), but more than doubled to 13.6 percent in 2013,  one of the highest in South America and the world."@en'),

The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and  established a Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima, which included most  of its South American colonies. After achieving independence in 1821,  Peru has undergone periods of political unrest and fiscal crisis as well  as periods of stability and economic upswing. Economic cycles have  mostly been based on the extraction of raw materials like guano  (1845–1866) and rubber (ca. 1900).Peru is a representative democratic  republic divided into 25 regions. Its geography varies from the arid  plains of the Pacific coast to the peaks of the Andes Mountains and the  tropical forests of the Amazon Basin.

With a  population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous  country in the world, the sixth most populous member of the European  Union, and the most populous post-communist member of the European  Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative  subdivisions.Many historians trace the establishment of a Polish state  to 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with  that of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. The Kingdom of  Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding  political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the  Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The  Commonwealth gradually ceased to exist in the years 1772–1795, when the  Polish territory was partitioned among Prussia, the Russian Empire, and  Austria. Poland regained its independence (as the Second Polish  Republic) at the end of World War I, in 1918.Two decades later, in  September 1939, World War II started with the invasions of Poland by  Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop  Pact). More than six million Polish citizens died in the war. In 1944, a  Soviet-backed Polish provisional government was formed, which, after a  period of conflict, falsified referendum and elections, gave rise to a  satellite state of the Soviet Union, Polish Republic (Rzeczpospolita  Polska), renamed to the People''s Republic of Poland (Polska  Rzeczpospolita Ludowa) in 1952. During the Revolutions of 1989, Poland''s  Marxist-Leninist government was overthrown and Poland adopted a new  constitution establishing itself as a democracy under the name  Rzeczpospolita Polska, often referred to as the "Third Polish Republic"  (III Rzeczpospolita).Despite the vast destruction the country  experienced during World War II, Poland managed to preserve much of its  cultural wealth.

The state shares its only land border with Northern  Ireland, one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. It is  surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south,  Saint George''s Channel to the south east, and the Irish Sea to the east.  It is a unitary, parliamentary republic with an elected president  serving as head of state. The head of government, the Taoiseach, is  nominated by the lower house of parliament, Dáil Éireann.Following the  Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty, Ireland  gained effective independence from the United Kingdom as the Irish Free  State in 1922. Northern Ireland exercised an option called the Ulster  Month to remain in the United Kingdom. Initially a dominion within the  British Empire (later the Commonwealth of Nations), the Free State  received official British recognition of full legislative independence  in the Statute of Westminster of 1931. A new constitution was adopted in  1937, by which the name of the state became Ireland. In 1949 the  remaining duties of the king — defined by the Executive Authority  (External Relations) Act 1936 — were removed and Ireland was declared a  republic under the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. The state had no formal  relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century, but  since 1999 the two have co-operated on a number of policy areas under  the North-South Ministerial Council created by the Good Friday  Agreement.Once one of western Europe''s poorest states, modern Ireland  now ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP  per capita. After joining the European Union (then called the European  Economic Community) in 1973, Ireland enacted a series of liberal  economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth. The country  achieved considerable prosperity from 1995 to 2007, during which it  became known as the Celtic Tiger. This was halted by an unprecedented  financial crisis that began in 2008, in conjunction with the concurrent  global economic crash.Although still recovering from its economic crash,  Ireland remains one of the world''s most prosperous nations. In 2011 and  2013, it was ranked as the seventh-most developed country in the world  by the United Nations Human Development Index. Ireland also performs  well in several metrics of national performance, including freedom of  the press, economic freedom and civil liberties. Ireland is a member of  the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and  the OECD. It pursues a policy of neutrality through non-alignment and  is consequently not a member of NATO, although it does participate in  Partnership for Peace."@en'),

Romania shares a border with Hungary and Serbia to the west,  Ukraine and Moldova to the northeast and east, and Bulgaria to the  south. At 238,391 square kilometres (92,043 sq mi), Romania is the ninth  largest country of the European Union by area, and has the 7th largest  population of the European Union with 20,121,641 people (October 2011).  Its capital and largest city is Bucharest – the 6th largest city in the  EU.The United Principalities emerged when the territories of Moldavia  and Wallachia were united under Prince Alexander Ioan Cuza in 1859. In  1866 Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was called to the throne as  the Ruling Prince of the Romanian Principate and in 1881 he was finally  crowned as King Carol I, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Romania.  Independence from the Ottoman Empire was declared on 9 May 1877, and was  internationally recognised the following year. At the end of World War  I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the Kingdom of  Romania.Following the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, the  Kingdom of Romania under King Carol II officially adopted a position of  neutrality. In summer 1940, a series of territorial disputes were  resolved unfavorably to Romania, resulting in the loss of most of the  territory gained in the wake of World War I. This caused the popularity  of Romania''s government to plummet. World War II gave cause to the rise  of a military dictatorship in Romania under far-right Marshal Ion  Antonescu, who chose to fight on the side of the Axis powers from  1941-44 in order to regain the provinces. After his removal, Romania  switched sides in 1944 and joined the Allies. By the end of the war,  some formerly Romanian northeastern territories were occupied by the  Soviet Union, with Red Army units stationed on Romanian soil. In 1947  Romania forcibly became a People''s Republic (1947–1965) and a member of  the Warsaw Pact. In 1965 Nicolae Ceaușescu became General Secretary of  the Romanian Workers'' Party, and the harsh austerity measures, political  repression, and cult of personality he implemented led to the Socialist  Republic of Romania (1965–1989) becoming the most Stalinist police  state in the Eastern bloc. Eventually his authoritarian government was  toppled in December 1989 during the Romanian Revolution.With the fall of  the Iron Curtain, Romania began its transition towards democracy and a  capitalist market economy. After a decade of post-revolution economic  problems and living-standards decline, extensive reforms fostered  economic recovery. As of 2010, Romania is an upper-middle income country  with a high Human Development Index. Romania joined NATO on 29 March  2004, and the European Union on 1 January 2007. It is a member of the  Latin Union, Francophonie, OSCE, WTO, BSEC, United Nations, etc. Romania  is a unitary semi-presidential republic, in which the executive branch  consists of the President and the Government."@en'),

Located a few  degrees south of the Equator, Rwanda is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania,  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rwanda is in the  African Great Lakes region and is highly elevated; its geography  dominated by mountains in the west and savanna to the east, with  numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate of the country is  temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons  each year.The population is young and predominantly rural, with a  density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans form three groups: the  Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descend  from Rwanda''s earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of  and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe they are  derived from former social castes, while others view them as being races  or tribes. Christianity is the largest religion in the country, the  principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with French  and English as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of  government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared  with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report  suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on  freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict  administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five  provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda has the world''s  highest proportion of females in government positions in proportion to  the population.Hunter gatherers settled the territory in the stone and  iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced  first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated  from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others  militarily, centralising power, and later enacting anti-Hutu policies.  Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed  by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during World War I. Both European  nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated pro-Tutsi policy. The  Hutu population revolted in 1959, massacring a large number of Tutsi and  ultimately establishing an independent Hutu-dominated state in 1962.  The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990,  which was followed by the 1994 genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed  an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF  ended the genocide with a military victory.Rwanda''s economy suffered  heavily during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, but has since strengthened.  The economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea  are the major cash crops for export. Tourism is a fast-growing sector  and is now the country''s leading foreign exchange earner; Rwanda is one  of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely,  and visitors are prepared to pay high prices for gorilla tracking  permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture,  particularly drums and the highly choreographed intore dance.  Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country,  including imigongo, a unique cow dung art."@en'),

Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the  north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and  Croatia, Bosnia, and Montenegro to the west; it also borders Albania  through the disputed territory of Kosovo. The capital of Serbia,  Belgrade, is among Europe''s oldest cities and one of the largest in  Southeast Europe.Serbs established several states in the early Middle  Ages following the Slavic migrations. The Serbian Kingdom obtained  recognition by Rome and Constantinople in 1217; the state was elevated  to the Serbian Empire, in 1346. By the mid-16th century, the entire  territory of modern-day Serbia was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, at  times interrupted by the Habsburgs. In the early 19th century, the  Serbian revolution established the nation-state as the region''s first  constitutional monarchy, which subsequently expanded its territory and  pioneered the abolition of feudalism in the Balkans. Following  disastrous casualties in World War I, and subsequent unification of  Habsburg crownlands of Vojvodina and Syrmia with Serbia, the country  co-founded Yugoslavia with other South Slavic peoples, which would exist  in various formations until 2006, when Montenegro declared its  independence. In 2008 the parliament of UNMIK Kosovo declared  independence, with divergent responses from the international  community.Serbia is a member of the UN, CoE, OSCE, PfP, BSEC, and CEFTA.  It is also an official candidate for membership in the European Union,  which is negotiating its EU accession, acceding country to the WTO and  is a militarily neutral state.Serbia has a high HDI and provides a  universal health care system and free primary and secondary education.  Among the region''s highest-scored "free countries" Serbia is an  upper-middle income economy (WB, IMF) with the service sector dominating  the country''s economy, followed by the industrial sector and  agriculture."@en'),

Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic with a  directly elected president and a unicameral legislature. The country  has a tropical climate, with a diverse environment ranging from savannah  to rainforests. The country covers a total area of 71,740 km2 (27,699  sq mi) and with an estimated population of 6 million (2011 United  Nations estimate).Sierra Leone is divided into four administrative  regions: the Northern Province, Eastern Province, Southern Province and  the Western Area; which are subdivided into fourteen districts. Each  district has its own directly elected local government known as district  council, headed by a council chairman, in whom local executive  authority is vested. Freetown is Sierra Leone''s capital, its largest  city as well as its economic, commercial and political centre. Bo is  Sierra Leone''s second-largest city and second major economic centre.  Since Independence to present, Sierra Leone''s politics has been  dominated by two major political parties: the Sierra Leone People''s  Party (SLPP) and the All People''s Congress (APC).The population of  Sierra Leone is comprised of about sixteen ethnic groups, each with its  own language and custom. The two largest and most influential are the  Temne and the Mende. The Temne are predominantly found in the north of  the country, while the Mende are predominant in the south-east.Sierra  Leone is a predominantly Muslim country, though with an influential  Christian minority. Sierra Leone is regarded as one of the most  religiously tolerant countries in the world. Muslims and Christians  collaborate and interact with each other peacefully in the country.  Religious violence is very rare in Sierra Leone.Although English is the  language of instruction in schools and the official language in  government administration, the Krio language (derived from English and  several indigenous African languages) is the primary language of  communication among Sierra Leone''s different ethnic groups, and is  spoken by 90% of the country''s population. The Krio Language serves to  unite the different ethnic groups, especially in their trade and daily  interaction with each other.Sierra Leone has relied on mining,  especially diamonds, for its economic base. It is also among the largest  producers of titanium and bauxite, a major producer of gold, and has  one of the world''s largest deposits of rutile. Sierra Leone is home to  the third-largest natural harbour in the world. Despite exploitation of  this natural wealth, 70% of its people live in poverty.In 1462, the  Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra visited this area, naming it Serra  Leoa, meaning "Lioness Mountains", for the landscape around Freetown.  Posts in Sierra Leone were developed as centres of the Atlantic slave  trade, and hundreds of thousands of Africans were transported from the  interior to the Americas through trading posts in Sierra Leone. n the  late 18th century, the British Crown established a colony at Freetown,  for resettlements of freed slaves. About 1200 Black Loyalists were  resettled from Nova Scotia on 11 March 1792; they were mostly African  Americans from the former colonies, now the United States. Slaves  liberated from illegal trade in the early nineteenth century joined  them, and they developed the Krio people and language. In 1808, Freetown  became a British Crown colony. In 1896, Britain annexed the interior of  the country as a British protectorate, changing its relations with the  paramount chiefs.The united country achieved independence in 1961.  Competition among rival groups finally opened into the Sierra Leone  Civil War (1991 to 2002), which over more than a decade devastated the  country. It left more than 50,000 people dead, much of the country''s  infrastructure destroyed, and over two million people displaced as  refugees in neighbouring countries."@en'),

The country''s territory  consists of the lozenge-shaped main island, commonly referred to as  Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60  significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular  Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the north, and from Indonesia''s Riau  Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. The country is highly  urbanised, and little of the original vegetation remains. The country''s  territory has consistently expanded through land reclamation.The islands  were settled in the second century AD and subsequently belonged to a  series of local empires. Modern Singapore was founded in 1819 by Sir  Stamford Raffles as a trading post of the East India Company with  permission from the Johor Sultanate. The British obtained sovereignty  over the island in 1824, and Singapore became one of the British Straits  Settlements in 1826. Occupied by the Japanese during World War II,  Singapore declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 and  united with other former British territories to form Malaysia, from  which it was expelled two years later through a unanimous act of  parliament. Since then, Singapore has developed rapidly, earning  recognition as one of the Four Asian Tigers.Singapore is one of the  world''s major commercial hubs, with the fourth-biggest financial centre  and one of the five busiest ports. Its globalised and diversified  economy depends heavily on trade, especially manufacturing, which  represented 26 percent of Singapore''s GDP in 2005. In terms of  purchasing power parity, Singapore has the third-highest per capita  income in the world. It places highly in international rankings with  regard to education, healthcare, government transparency, and economic  competitiveness.Singapore is a unitary multiparty parliamentary  republic, with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary  government. The People''s Action Party has won every election since  self-government began in 1959. Just over five million people live in  Singapore, of which approximately two million are foreign-born. While  Singapore is diverse, ethnic Asians predominate: 75 percent of the  population is Chinese, with significant minorities of Malays, Indians,  and Eurasians. There are four official languages, English, Malay,  Chinese, and Tamil, and the country promotes multiculturalism through a  range of official policies.One of the five founding members of the  Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore is also the  host of the APEC Secretariat, and a member of the East Asia Summit, the  Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth.

In  the 7th century, Slavs inhabiting this territory played a significant  role in the creation of Samo''s Empire, historically the first Slavic  state which had its center in Western Slovakia. During the 9th century,  Slavic ancestors of the Slovaks established another political entity,  the Principality of Nitra, which later together with the Principality of  Moravia, formed Great Moravia.

The  main economic field is services, followed by industry and  construction.Historically, the current territory of Slovenia was part of  many different state formations, including the Roman Empire and the  Holy Roman Empire, followed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In October  1918, the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by  co-founding the internationally unrecognized State of Slovenes, Croats  and Serbs, which merged that December with the Kingdom of Serbia into  the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia  in 1929). During World War II, Slovenia was occupied and annexed by  Germany, Italy, Croatia, and Hungary. Afterward, it was a founding  member of the Federal People''s Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In June 1991, after the  introduction of multi-party representative democracy, Slovenia split  from Yugoslavia and became an independent country.

The name Korea  is derived from Goryeo, a dynasty which ruled in the Middle Ages. It  shares land borders with North Korea to the north, and oversea borders  with China to the west and Japan to the east. South Korea lies in the  north temperate zone with a predominantly mountainous terrain. Roughly  half of the country''s 50 million people reside in the metropolitan area  surrounding its capital, the Seoul Capital Area, which is the second  largest in the world with over 25 million residents.Archaeology  indicates that the Korean Peninsula was occupied by the Lower  Paleolithic period (2.6 Ma–300 Ka). The history of Korea begins with the  founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC by the legendary Dangun. Following the  unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Silla AD 668, Korea was  ruled by the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) and Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910).  It was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. At the end of World War  II, Korea was divided into Soviet and U.S. zones of occupation. An  election held in the U.S. zone in 1948 led to the creation of the  Republic of Korea. Although the United Nations passed a resolution  declaring the Republic to be the only lawful government in Korea, a  communist government was soon set up in the North that invaded the South  in 1950, leading to the Korean War that ended de facto in 1953.Between  1962 and 1994, the South Korean economy grew at an average of 10%  annually, fueled by annual export growth of 20%, in a period called the  Miracle on the Han River that rapidly transformed it into an affluent  G-20 major economy and the world''s seventh largest country in  international trade. Civilian government replaced military rule in 1987  and the country has since become Asia''s most advanced democracy as rated  by The Economist''s Democracy Index. In 2009, South Korea became the  world''s first former aid recipient to join the OECD''s Development  Assistance Committee, graduating to a major donor.

Although the Spanish never  colonized the Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans to slavery in  Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when  English colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.The  Bahamas became a British Crown colony in 1718, when the British clamped  down on piracy. After the American War of Independence, thousands of  American Loyalists, taking their enslaved Africans, moved to the  Bahamas, where the Americans set up a plantation economy. After Britain  abolished the international slave trade in 1807, the Royal Navy  resettled many free Africans liberated from illegal slave ships in the  Bahamas during the 19th century. Hundreds of American slaves and Black  Seminoles escaped to the islands from Florida, and nearly 500 were freed  from American merchant ships in the domestic trade. Slavery in the  Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Today the descendants of slaves and free  Africans form the majority of the population; issues related to the  slavery years are part of society. The Bahamas became an independent  Commonwealth realm in 1973, retaining Queen Elizabeth II as its  monarch.In terms of gross domestic product per capita, the Bahamas is  one of the richest countries in the Americas (following the United  States and Canada)."@en'),

The Mediterranean Sea is  to the south; the Aegean Sea is to the west; and the Black Sea is to the  north. The Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles (which  together form the Turkish Straits) demarcate the boundary between Thrace  and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey''s location at  the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it a country of significant  geostrategic importance.Turkey has been inhabited since the paleolithic  age, including various Ancient Anatolian civilizations and Thracian  peoples. After Alexander the Great''s conquest, the area was Hellenized,  which continued with the Roman rule and the transition into the  Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the  11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was greatly  accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of  Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the  Mongol invasion in 1243, upon which it disintegrated into several small  Turkish beyliks.Starting from the late 13th century, the Ottoman beylik  united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern  Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia  and Africa during the early modern period. After the Ottoman Empire  collapsed following its defeat in World War I, parts of it were occupied  by the victorious Allies. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues, resulted in the establishment  of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first  president.Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, constitutional  republic with a diverse cultural heritage. The country''s official  language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by approximately  85% of the population. Turks constitute 70% to 75% of the population.  Minorities include Kurds (18%) and others (7–12%). The vast majority of  the population is Muslim. Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe,  NATO, OECD, OSCE and the G-20 major economies.

As a consequence of the referendum, the  Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony ceased to exist on 1 January 1976 and  the separate British colonies of Kiribati and Tuvalu came into  existence.

The state of Alaska is the  northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an  archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and  nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79  million square miles (9.83 million km2) in total and with around 317  million people, the United States is the third or fourth-largest country  by total area and third largest by population. It is one of the world''s  most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of  large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate  of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide  variety of wildlife.Paleo-indians migrated from Asia to what is now the  U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization  beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British  colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great  Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4,  1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration  of Independence. The ensuing war ended in 1783 with the recognition of  independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and  was the first successful war of independence against a European  colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17,  1787. The first 10 amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights,  were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and  freedoms.Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States  embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the  19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new  territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War  ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the  United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the  world''s largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the  country''s status as a global military power. The United States emerged  from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear  weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.  The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left  the United States as the sole superpower.The United States is a  developed country and has the world''s largest national economy, with an  estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and  19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of  natural resources and the world''s highest worker productivity, with per  capita GDP being the world''s sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S.  economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the  world''s largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and  second-highest median household income in the OECD as well as the  highest average wage, though it has the fourth most unequal income  distribution among OECD nations with roughly 16% of the population  living in poverty. The country accounts for 36.6% of global military  spending, being the world''s foremost economic and military power, a  prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific  research and technological innovation."@en'),

Venezuela''s territory covers around 916,445 square kilometres (353,841  sq mi) with an estimated population of approximately 29,100,000.  Venezuela is considered a state with extremely high biodiversity, with  habitats ranging from the Andes mountains in the west to the Amazon  Basin rainforest in the south, via extensive llanos plains and Caribbean  coast in the center and the Orinoco River Delta in the east.Venezuela  was colonized by Spain in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples.  In 1811 it became one of the first Spanish-American colonies to (declare  independence), which was not securely establish until 1821, when  Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of Gran Colombia. It  gained full independence as a separate country in 1830. During the 19th  century Venezuela suffered political turmoil and dictatorship, remaining  dominated by regional caudillos (military strongmen) until the mid-20th  century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic  governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several  political crises, including the deadly Caracazo riots of 1989, two  attempted coups in 1992, and the impeachment of President Carlos Andrés  Pérez for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in confidence  in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of former career officer  Hugo Chávez and the launch of the Bolivarian Revolution, beginning with a  1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of  Venezuela.Venezuela is a federal presidential republic consisting of 23  states, the Capital District (covering Caracas), and Federal  Dependencies (covering Venezuela''s offshore islands). Venezuela also  claims all Guyanese territory west of the Essequibo River, a 159,500  square kilometres (61,583 sq mi) tract dubbed Guayana Esequiba or the  Zona en Reclamación (the "zone being reclaimed").Venezuela is among the  most urbanized countries in Latin America; the vast majority of  Venezuelans live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital,  Caracas, which is also the largest city in Venezuela. Since the  discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of  the world''s leading exporters of oil and has the largest oil reserves.  Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such  as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government  revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a  long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996  and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995 as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell  to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.The recovery  of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated  social spending which significantly reduced inequality and poverty,  although the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis saw a renewed  economic downturn. By late 2010 Venezuela''s economy had some growth,  though this has been sluggish and accompanied by high inflation and  shortages. In February 2013, Venezuela devalued its currency due to the  rising shortages in the country. Shortages of items included toilet  paper, milk, flour and other necessities.

Successive Vietnamese royal dynasties  flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into  Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was colonized by the  French in the mid-19th century. Following a Japanese occupation in the  1940s, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the First Indochina War,  eventually expelling the French in 1954. Thereafter, Vietnam was divided  politically into two rival states, North and South Vietnam. Conflict  between the two sides intensified, with heavy intervention from the  United States, in what is known as the Vietnam War. The war ended with a  North Vietnamese victory in 1975.Vietnam was then unified under a  Communist government but remained impoverished and politically isolated.  In 1986, the government initiated a series of economic and political  reforms which began Vietnam''s path towards integration into the world  economy.

In 275  AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish influenced  Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the 4th century AD whereas  Judaism and local Paganism was already established. Islam spread quickly  in 7th century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the  early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been  notoriously difficult.
